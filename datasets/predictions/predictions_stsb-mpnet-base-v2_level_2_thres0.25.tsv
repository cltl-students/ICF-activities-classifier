I couldn't mop the floor like how I did before anymore.	4
I am sorry to hear that, but why?	9
I could mop the floor of the whole appartement before. But now, I get pain in my waist already after mopping just the living room floor. I can not bend my waist for a long while anymore.	3
True, bending for a long time will cause excessive load on your waist. Do you need to do any other chores or movement that will require you to bend your waist for a long time?	3
I also did quite some gardening recently. Maybe that also hurt my waist.	9
It might be. You'd better take a rest for a few days and avoid bending your waist. Even if you need to bend your waist, you 'd better just keep it for just a really short while. And if you still have the pain, it's necessary to visit the doctor.	4
