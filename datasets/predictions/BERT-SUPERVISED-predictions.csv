109	Yes, you can try this method, maybe it would help.	9	0

112	Yes, I think they quite busy and that's why I don't want to bother them.	6	6
113	Maybe you can have video call with them. Ask how are they recently and tell them that you miss them.	6	6

153	Yes I did	9	9
154	I also send you a text message	9	2
155	yes, I saw that too	9	9
156	Did you understand the text? and how come you did not answer?	2	2
157	I understood you perfectly, but suppose I did not have time and forgot all about it	2	9
158	My phone is quite old, it is hard to communicate with it	2	2
159	maybe ring next time. that is always quicker	2	2
160	So when you call me, I might not hear you	2	2

162	Can you send me a text message if you want to tell me something	2	2
163	I will send you a spoken message instead	2	2

174	Yes they do, but we should not forget how important face-to-face communication is	9	2
175	I agree, I have a hard time to understand all the communication on a phone?	2	2
176	So you prefer to talk face-to face?	2	2
177	Yes I do, but I am willing to learn all the new options to communicate!	2	0

190	that might be a good explanation for a deteriorating physical fitness. Dit recieve any rehabilitation afterwards?	9	4
191	no I did not, because I never had trouble climbing the stairs	3	3
192	It might be a good idea to start exercising and strengthen your muscles for stair climbing	9	0
193	I thought taking more walk outside. Do you think that helps for stair climbing as well	9	3
194	in general you should be able to walk stairs if you take daily walks	3	3

242	I understand, I feel the same, but I like to go to the gym instead and talk to people	8	6
243	Well, I used to go to the gym before and I already had many friends there, but now I rather to save that money	1	8

269	No, don't think so. Let;s just hope they won't climb the high tower, I am afraid to watch them if they climb	8	9
270	No they won't, we can watch them from the bench in the park	5	8
271	I always take a shower by myself	4	4

301	My neighbor makes loud noise during the late night quite often recently.	6	6
302	Then you should tell him that you are bothered by the noise.	6	6
303	But I have good relationship with him. I feel quite embarrased to complaint about the noise. I have been tangled with the thoughts for a few days already.	6	6
304	No worries, if you are friends, he will understand you.	6	6
305	You know, I don't quarrel with my neighbor becasue of this.	6	6

307	My friend from anti-war association and I feel quite angry about the U.S. blaming the conflicts between Ukrain and Russia.	8	6
308	What do you think about that?	8	9
309	Well, I think politians should help both sides to sit down and talk to resolve the conflict in a peaceful way. But not constantly sending weapons to make the situation worse.	8	6
310	But what can you do about it?	9	2
311	Of course there is something I can do.  Our association will hold a protest next week	8	8

319	oh yes, but there is a difference compared to a couple of years ago in doing the dishes	5	5

439	When did you notice that?	9	2
440	It starts around 1 year ago but it didn't affect my daily life yet. So I didn't care about it that much. However, recently, when I talked to my friends, I had to ask them to speak louder quite often so that I can hear what they said.	2	2
441	Have your ears ever been hurt or impaired by very loud sounds?	9	2
442	None that I've known of.	9	9

487	It occurs when I climb the stairs or when Istand up from a squat.	9	3
488	How stong does it feel?	9	2
489	Sometime, I feel like I cannot stand steadily and have to hold something to support myself.	3	3
490	How long does it take to recover from the rush?	9	9
491	Around half a minute, somthing like that.	9	9
492	Did you measure you blood pressure recently?	9	4
493	Nope	9	9
494	Maybe we should first mesure your blood pressure.	9	4
495	I couldn't mop the floor like how I did before anymore.	5	5
496	I am sorry to hear that, but why?	9	9
497	I could mop the floor of the whole appartement before. But now, I get pain in my waist already after mopping just the living room floor. I can not bend my waist for a long while anymore.	5	5
498	True, bending for a long time will cause excessive load on your waist. Do you need to do any other chores or movement that will require you to bend your waist for a long time?	5	3
499	I also did quite some gardening recently. Maybe that also hurt my waist.	5	5
500	It might be. You'd better take a rest for a few days and avoid bending your waist. Even if you need to bend your waist, you 'd better just keep it for just a really short while. And if you still have the pain, it's necessary to visit the doctor.	9	4
501	How is your education going?	7	0
502	I am too tired to study well at the moment	0	0

523	And do you help each other when necessary?	6	6
524	Yes, we can always ask our neighbors for help.	6	6
525	That's important, it's not always like that.	9	9
526	No, in big cities you can live very anonymously	9	7
527	People can get lonely	6	9
528	Yes, promoting contacts in the neighborhood can be important when people are in need of help	8	8

535	How do mean?	9	2
536	I mean, people really care for eachother 	6	6
537	That must bring a lot of support and comfort to people	6	8
538	yes, especcially to the vulnerable people in our community	9	8

556	Did you do something interesting today?	9	9
557	Not really, I just went to work in the morning and had a couple of meetings in the morning	7	1
558	Well, meetings can also be fun sometimes. But how was your day overall?	9	2
559	It was good after the meeting I helped a colleague with an interesting task and then went to get a coffe	1	1
560	Then went back to my office to work on the code and finish a document for my supervisor	7	1
561	Sounds like a very productive day, did you do something else to relax after work?	1	9
562	Well, after work I was hungry so I decided to make dinner and work a bit on my personal project	5	5
