       "'Activities and Participation \\nACTIVITIES AND \\nPARTICIPATION \\nICF \\n \\nDefinitions: \\nActivity is the execution of a task or action by an individual.  \\n Participation is involvement in a life situation.  \\n Activity limitations are difficulties an individual may have in \\nexecuting activities. \\nParticipation restrictions are problems an individual may \\nexperience in involvement in life situations.  \\nQualifiers \\nThe domains for the Activities and Participation component are given in a single \\nlist that covers the full range of life areas (from basic learning and watching to \\ncomposite areas such as social tasks).  This component can be used to denote \\nactivities (a) or participation (p) or both.  \\nThe two qualifiers for the Activities and Participation component are the \\nperformance qualifier and the capacity qualifier. The performance qualifier \\ndescribes what an individual does in his or her current environment. Because the \\ncurrent environment brings in a societal context, performance as recorded by \\nthis qualifier can also be understood  as \"involvement in a life situation\" or \"the \\nlived experience\" of people in the actual context in which they live. This context \\nincludes the environmental factors – all aspects of the physical, social and \\nattitudinal world, which can be coded using the Environmental Factors \\ncomponent.  \\nThe capacity qualifier describes an individual’s ability to execute a task or an \\naction. This qualifier identifies the highest probable level of functioning that a \\nperson may reach in a given domain at a given moment. Capacity is measured in \\na uniform or standard environment, and thus reflects the environmentally \\nadjusted ability of the individual. The Environmental Factors component can be \\nused to describe the features of this uniform or standard environment.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n127 \\nActivities and Participation \\n \\nBoth capacity and performance qualifiers can be used both with and without \\nassistive devices or personal assistance, and in accordance with the following \\nscale: \\n \\nxxx.0  NO difficulty \\nxxx.1  MILD difficulty  \\nxxx.2  MODERATE difficulty \\nxxx.3  SEVERE difficulty  \\nxxx.4 COMPLETE difficulty \\nxxx.8  not specified \\nxxx.9  not applicable \\n(none, absent, negligible,… ) \\n(slight, low,…) \\n(medium, fair,...) \\n(high, extreme, …) \\n(total,…) \\n \\nICF \\n0-4 % \\n5-24 % \\n25-49 % \\n50-95 % \\n96-100 % \\n \\nBroad ranges of percentages are provided for those cases in which calibrated \\nassessment instruments or other standards are available to quantify the \\nperformance problem or capacity limitation.  For example, when no \\nperformance problem or a complete performance problem is coded, this scaling \\nhas a margin of error of up to 5%. A moderate performance problem is defined \\nas up to half of the scale of a total performance problem. The percentages are to \\nbe calibrated in different domains with reference to population standards as \\npercentiles. For this quantification to be used in a uniform manner, assessment \\nprocedures need to be developed through  research. \\nFor a further explanation of coding convention in ICF, refer to Annex 2.  \\n \\n \\n \\n128 \\nICF \\nActivities and Participation \\nChapter 1   \\nLearning and applying knowledge \\nThis chapter is about learning, applying the knowledge that is learned, thinking, \\nsolving problems, and  making decisions. \\n \\nPurposeful sensory experiences (d110-d129) \\n \\n d 110   Watching \\nUsing the sense of seeing intentionally to experience visual stimuli, \\nsuch as watching a sporting event or children playing. \\n \\n d 115   Listening \\nUsing the sense of hearing intentionally to experience auditory stimuli, \\nsuch as listening to a radio, music or a lecture. \\n \\n d 120   Other purposeful sensing \\nUsing the body’s other basic senses intentionally to experience stimuli, \\nsuch as touching and feeling textures, tasting sweets or smelling \\nflowers. \\n \\n d 129   Purposeful sensory experiences, other specified and unspecified \\n \\nBasic learning (d130-d159) \\n \\n d 130   Copying \\nImitating or mimicking as a basic component of learning, such as \\ncopying a gesture, a sound or the letters of an alphabet. \\n \\n d 135   Rehearsing \\nRepeating a sequence of events or symbols as a basic component of \\nlearning, such as counting by tens or practising the recitation of a \\npoem. \\n \\n d 140   Learning to read \\nDeveloping the competence to read written material (including Braille) \\nwith fluency and accuracy, such as recognizing characters and \\nalphabets, sounding out words with correct pronunciation, and \\nunderstanding words and phrases. \\n \\n \\n129 \\nActivities and Participation \\n \\n d 145   Learning to write \\nICF \\nDeveloping the competence to produce symbols that represent sounds, \\nwords or phrases in order to convey meaning (including Braille \\nwriting), such as spelling effectively and using correct grammar. \\n \\n d 150   Learning to calculate \\nDeveloping the competence to manipulate numbers and perform simple \\nand complex mathematical operations, such as using mathematical \\nsigns for addition and subtraction and applying the correct \\nmathematical operation to a problem. \\n \\n d 155   Acquiring skills \\nDeveloping basic and complex competencies in integrated sets of \\nactions or tasks so as to initiate and follow through with the acquisition \\nof a skill, such as manipulating tools or playing games like chess. \\nInclusions:  acquiring basic and complex skills \\nd 1550  Acquiring basic skills  \\nLearning elementary, purposeful actions, such as learning to \\nmanipulate eating utensils, a pencil or a simple tool. \\nd 1551  Acquiring complex skills  \\nLearning integrated sets of actions so as to follow rules, and to \\nsequence and coordinate one\\'s movements, such as learning to \\nplay games like football or to use a building tool. \\nd 1558  Acquiring skills, other specified  \\nd 1559  Acquiring skills, unspecified  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n d 159   Basic learning, other specified and unspecified \\n \\nApplying knowledge  (d160-d179) \\n \\n d 160   Focusing attention \\nIntentionally focusing on specific stimuli, such as by filtering out \\ndistracting noises. \\n \\n \\n130 \\nICF \\n d 163   Thinking \\nActivities and Participation \\nFormulating and manipulating ideas, concepts, and images, whether \\ngoal-oriented or not, either alone or with others, such as creating \\nfiction, proving a theorem, playing with ideas, brainstorming, \\nmeditating, pondering, speculating, or reflecting. \\nExclusions: solving problems (d175);
