Activities and Participation ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION ICF  Definitions: Activity is the execution of a task or action by an individual.   Participation is involvement in a life situation.   Activity limitations are difficulties an individual may have in executing activities. Participation restrictions are problems an individual may experience in involvement in life situations.  Qualifiers The domains for the Activities and Participation component are given in a single list that covers the full range of life areas from basic learning and watching to composite areas such as social tasks.  This component can be used to denote activities a or participation p or both.  The two qualifiers for the Activities and Participation component are the performance qualifier and the capacity qualifier. The performance qualifier describes what an individual does in his or her current environment. Because the current environment brings in a societal context, performance as recorded by this qualifier can also be understood  as "involvement in a life situation" or "the lived experience" of people in the actual context in which they live. This context includes the environmental factors – all aspects of the physical, social and attitudinal world, which can be coded using the Environmental Factors component.  The capacity qualifier describes an individual’s ability to execute a task or an action. This qualifier identifies the highest probable level of functioning that a person may reach in a given domain at a given moment. Capacity is measured in a uniform or standard environment, and thus reflects the environmentally adjusted ability of the individual. The Environmental Factors component can be used to describe the features of this uniform or standard environment.        Activities and Participation  Both capacity and performance qualifiers can be used both with and without assistive devices or personal assistance, and in accordance with the following scale:    NO difficulty   MILD difficulty    MODERATE difficulty   SEVERE difficulty   COMPLETE difficulty   not specified   not applicable none, absent, negligible,…  slight, low,… medium, fair,... high, extreme, … total,…  ICF 0-4 % 5-24 % 25-49 % 50-95 % 96- %  Broad ranges of percentages are provided for those cases in which calibrated assessment instruments or other standards are available to quantify the performance problem or capacity limitation.  For example, when no performance problem or a complete performance problem is coded, this scaling has a margin of error of up to 5%. A moderate performance problem is defined as up to half of the scale of a total performance problem. The percentages are to be calibrated in different domains with reference to population standards as percentiles. For this quantification to be used in a uniform manner, assessment procedures need to be developed through  research. For a further explanation of coding convention in ICF, refer to Annex 2.
