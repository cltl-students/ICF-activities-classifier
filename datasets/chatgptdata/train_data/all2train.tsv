So, do you find it easy to go grocery shopping or do everyday tasks nowadays?	1
F; “That’s great to hear!”	6
Well, not much. Just spending most of the time at home.	5
Oh, today was a bit more exciting than usual. I went to my weekly volunteer work for community services, helping others through counseling and mentorship.	8

I've been alright, just trying to keep up with everything around the house.	5
I typically just make pancakes or scrambled eggs. Occasionally I'll make oatmeal or cinnamon rolls from scratch.	5
Fortunately, I’m not completely dependent on fast food; I know a few tricks to cooking an easy meal using only fresh produce.	0
One time, I just tampered getting caution out and left mechanism hanging, real-life breaker with knowledge ceased plus handled in life process till done wrong.	1
Sounds simple and delicious! How about after breakfast, is there anything you do then?	6
Yeah, I'm used to cooking meals twice a day at home. Maybe I cooked a vegetable curry last night for dinner.	5

What about when you can't find the food that you planned to heat up?	5
Hi! It's good to see you again. How are you doing, today?	6

Oh, wow. Is heshe a pro-singer already? , 	2
Oh, I'm not feeling too bad, thank you.	2
Well, I gestured towards my front yard when talking about my own garden, and my neighbor did the same.	2
It was pretty good. I spent the morning reading the newspaper.	0
The news as usual. Also, I saw an advertisement and heard the phone ring.	2
Yes, I enjoy beautiful old songs, classical melodies recorded a few decades ago.	0
You know, we had some confusion regarding the medication changes, but she’s usually clear whenever I remind her.	2
Yes, I've been learning a new method of communication called memos so I'm doing communication testing at night regarding short-term memory and simple recalling. 	0

That sounds delicious! Is it a typical meal you make at home? 	5
What does your morning routine look like? 	9
Actually it felt great to have my own meal rather disturb the nurses. Plus controlling what I put into my body is a feeling of progress rather than sitting and feeling sick all day.	4
Yes, they are convenient and easy to prepare. I usually buy them a dozen at a time.	5
I added olive oil onto a heated pan and spread sauteed garlic after 30 seconds.	5
That makes a lot of sense. And what about meals -- did you make something good today?	6
What did you have for breakfast this morning?	9
Oh yeah? What happened there? Did everything go well? 	2
I understand. How else do you communicate throughout your day?	6
A little bit. My hearing isn't very good right now, so I had to turn up the volume on my phone.	2

Understandable. well then, I noticed your	9

What types of communication events did you have yesterday, Mr.Ms. patient? 	2
Oh yes, I have a hearing aid that works quite well.	2
Yes, I spoke to the checkout cashier. 	2
Not really, unfortunately. Since my hearing isn't what it used to be, it's harder for me to have longer conversations that intersted me, so I don't often seek out company anymore.	6
And did you do anything else beside that?	9
Great! How about some recent new happenings at home, who did you inform immediately?	6

How did you communicate with your granddaughter last night, Mr. Thompson?	2
That's nice! How about when you want to communicate with others?	2

Oh, not too bad, thanks for askin'.	2
That's nice, how did you interact with them? 	2

It was okay. A caring person on the bus today actually got a seat for me on the bus.	8
I understand how that can be really difficult. Could you tell me about a specific example when you felt like your interactions with people might be affecting your relationships?	6
How has your day been going so far?	9
That's great to hear. What else have you done today that involved interactions with others?	6
Yes, for the most part. As I've gotten older, I've developed my own ways of dealing with people, and most of the interactions I have are quite good.	6
Maybe a change in approach would help. Have you tried using I-messages instead of blaming language like you never listen?	6
It was good. In all honesty though, I miss having company around as I feel life gets too isolated.	6
Well, a few weeks ago we all went out to eat together. My sister ordered onion rings and I made a comment about how she always picks greasy foods. She didn't take it as a joke and we started bickering back	6
Hey there, how was your day?	2

Do you often see positive responses to your verbal	2
Yes, actually my caretaker came over to help me with some chores around the house earlier.	5
Yes, I depend on them to leave a voicemail if I am not able to answer the call unlike my younhger months when I used hearing hardwares to enchance my belongingschaftions with others unfamiliar or had hearing losses and it sheikred my confidence deeply. As for habitual communication everything became history for i'm already embrace deathess tendence6 everywhere.The peace I've maintained by this decision has suffused my	9
What did you do today?	7
Oh, what happened? Could you tell me more about what happened?	6
That's lovely! Have you; had trouble remembering things people said later on?	2
It does make sense! Any other instances when you experience those barriers to communicating?	2
It Was very busy today!	1
Well, it started out fine. In the morning, I watched the morning news to catch up on what's happening in the world.	0
Oh yeah, sounds fruitful! Do you usually hear the newsreadings on radios or TVs?	2

So, how was your day going?	6
I like to have them on in the background while I'm doing household chores or when I go for a walk in the park.	5
Hmm.. Oh, that reminds me. Just this afternoon i thought was great one of doctors' facial conveyed stances. Very straight forward confirmation politely my sentiment prompting convenient arrangement gave me personally multiple talking points.

That's understandable. Have you considered asking for help with those	6
I clean my apartmenttwicea day. 	5
Well, I suppose keeping up with the housework keeps me moving.	5
Yes, I did. But when I came back, I couldn't remember if I turned off the oven. I had to go back and check it.	4
Sometimes I go take a walk around the park or try to cook for myself. It’s just hard standing for too long these days.	3
How are you feeling today?	2
It's the usual routine for me. Woke up in the morning, took a quick shower, and made breakfast.	5
I see. What have you been up to lately that's been making you so tired?	6
Alright, did you have any difficulties while doing it?	9
Well, I get tired more easily nowadays. Fortunately, my granddaughter mainly pushed the cart and she commended me on being able to retrieve most things without any issue. 	3
Generally, I do some errands like grocery shopping or attend doctor’s appointment few times in	8
Could you tell me more about that? 	9
I usually have breakfast and then take a shower. It takes around 30 minutes.	4
Oh yes, I found it was a little windy today, yet invigorating as always.	9
Just simple ones such as cooking meals and taking care of the house's moderate cleanliness.	5
Even if activities' levels of complication varied a lot – dusting some ceramics and glass display which sorted up carrying comparatively sterile itzes up and down; creating environmentally secure mounting for the suet bag bunch obstruct my final single-task devoted nerves.But switching rew itself along throughout work day became necessary to complete household backup before the guests pop.	5
How are you feeling today?	2
Can you tell me a bit more about your routines?	9
That sounds great! Do you have anything planned throughout the day?	1
That is completely understandable. Do you think managing multiple tasks at once is something you do well with handle every day?	1
Well, today I tried to organize a small part of my bookshelf, it didn't end well.	5
That sounds like a great start to the day. What do you do afterwards?	7
Not very. Occasionally, I struggle with trickier lids like on Spill-Proof cups. But, if it's friendly bottle or	4
Could you give me an example of what is difficult?	9
Well, have you tried using a straw to drink instead? 	4
What time of day do you normally enjoy a nice cup of tea?	4
So, how was your day today?	6
How was your day today, sir?	6

Hi! How's your day so far?	2
So How was your day? What did you do?	2
What happened at the store?	9

It's good to meet helpful people at the store! What else did you do?	6
So how has your week been?	9
Overall it's been good, but I had kind of an awkward encounter this afternoon actually.	7
Awkward encounter? What happened, tell me more about it?	7
That does sound a little embarrassing. Did you apologize and quickly move to the back of the line?	6
yes, Yes, definitely. I was surprised that I cut line and made a mistake, Never meant to do it, but the guy acted very angry.	6
Oof, did that make things better	6
Hey, how are you feeling today?	2
I'm bored, to be honest.	9
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you could tell me about something you've done today?	2
I had a chat with one of my neighbors earlier.	6
That sounds nice. How did it go?	2
It was alright. We mostly talked about how their vegetable garden is coming along.	6
Yes. I was outside checking the mail, and they were out in their garden at the same time.	6
Great. Did you learn anything interesting?	0
They offered me some fresh cucumbers that they just picked. Can't wait	5
Good morning! How are you doing today?	2
Hello! I'm doing okay. It’s been an interesting few days.	2
Really, why is that? 	2
I started talking to a neighbour for the first time. I saw the neighbour outside and started a conversation!	6
When did you start talking and what did you talk about?	2
 P: It happened yesterday, I just greeted them in the morning and started to ask some questions about their vegetable garden. It turns out we had some things in common!	2
I felt pretty good; excieted to	9
What did you do yesterday?	9
Yesterday, I went for a walk in the neighborhood park.	3
Did you talk with anyone at the park?	2
Yes, while I was walking in the garden, I met a few people and said hi to them.	2
Oh, what type of people were they?	9
They were just random people, maybe other people living nearby walking in the garden.	9
That's good, did you have a conversation with anybody in particular?	2
Yes actually, I talked to this lady with her dog that I see few times a week and we exchanged pleasantries.	2
So how has your day been?	2
Well, it has been pretty good. Except for this one experience.	9
Oh no, what happened?	2
I went to the grocery store and wanted to ask the employee where to find some honey, but I guess I didn't speak loudly enough because they didn't seem to hear me.	2
Did you try asking someone else for help?	2
Yes, another person tried to help me, luckily.	2
Where else have you had similar interactions?	9
At church. Sometimes I can't quite understand what the priest is saying during his sermon.	2
Have you tried sitting closer or asking someone after the church service for clarification	2
That sounds really nice. Do you ever watch TV or movies with any of your friends from here ?	2
I occasionally stay seated outside multiple rooms including mutual friend's Jessie who itself next watches morning TV series except some remote squeezing	2
What have you been up to lately? 	9
 P: I went to the park today.	8
 F: That sounds nice. 	9
 P: Yeah, I run into my ex-girlfriend there.	6
 F: Oh, how did that go?	6
 P: It was a little uncomfortable. 	6
 P: She said hi, but that was about it.	6
 F: Can I ask what happened?	6
 P: We broke up about a year ago.	6
 F: I’m sorry to hear that.	6
 P: The relationship was just not working out.	6
 F: Have you been dating anyone else since?	6
 P: Not really, just going out with some friends.	8
Hi, any interesting stories you have from the past few days?	2
Yes, actually something quite embarrassing happened to me at the grocery store the other day.	9
Well, I was having trouble finding a certain product so I asked one of the employees for help. I couldn't hear her very well from behind our masks...	2
Ah, I've had that trouble before!	2
Anyway, I had quite a hard time understanding her so I said ‘what？’ multiple times before it clicked to me that I might just botch her messages, of which when I realized that she was someone for whom English was a second-language… and my hearing certainly isn't as good as it used	2
What did you do today, did you talk with anyone you know?	2
Oh, did you find the item alright?	2
Did you have a lot of trouble looking for it? 	2
What did you do yesterday, and did you meet with anyone special?	9
That looks interesting. When and how did you notice that teenager?	9
Oh right. How were you traveling that day, bus?	9
Therefore, how did you	9
Hi, how are you doing today?	2
I'm good, thank you for asking. How about you?	2
Oh, why do you think so?	2
When I was young, I had tons of energy to go out and interact with people. Now, I often feel challenged in gently approaching strangers to start up conversations, especially without any given common experiences the both parties could relate to.	6
Yeah, it definitely feels harder to connect with strangers sometimes.	6
Definitely, travelling on public transport could be stressful if it full of spectators struggling to accept they see world with perception tunaled and filter important close not societal	8
How was your day, Jean? 	2
It was fine, Judy. I talked with my neighbor today. 	6
That’s great! What did you talk about? 	2
We talked about her garden. She showed me her new summer plants and I asked her where she got the seeds. 	6
Was she friendly? 	2
Was it easy to keep the conversation going? 	2
Yes, she's easy to talk to. 	6
Did you learn about new plants that you want to create a garden with? 	0
Yes, actually. She showed me a new plant and I can't wait to include it in my garden. 	0
When will	9
So how's your day been so far, still coping with COVID?	2
Yes, it’s just been mundane. Nothing very exceptional. 	9
It doesn't sound like you had a lot to make out of your day. Letme ask do you run together with local Senior Runners’ Clubhere in our state?	6
How has your day been going, Mrs. Johnson?	2
Oh, not too bad, thank you. How about yourself?	2
Doing well! What sorts of interactions with others have you had so far today?	6
Well, I called my daughter this morning to check in on her and chat. Then I spoke with my neighbor when we crossed paths heading outside to check the mail.	6
That's great to hear you regularly touch base with family and friends. How did the conversation with your daughter go?	2
Good, we caught up on her recent trip. She went to California for a work conference. It sounded interesting.	2
It's always fun to hear exciting experiences! What kind of interaction took place between you	6
How was your day yesterday?	2
It was not bad.	9
No, I didn't meet anyone new	9
Ok ... did you happen to engage in a conversation with anyone?	2
Sure, bumped into a friendly woman on the street. We had small conversation for a few minutes. 	6
That sounds nice. Was it easy to keep the conversation going for those few minutes?	2
Yes, she showed genuine interest in what I had to say, and asked questions calmly to get more insight into it.	2
That's great to hear. When you engage in a conversation, like that today, do you happen to initiate the discussion first, or is it always some	9
Hi, how are you today?	2
I'm doing alright, thank you.	2
That's good to hear. I was just curious, have you had any interesting interactions with others recently?	6
Oh really? How did that go?	2
It was great! We talked about our gardens and shared some tips.	6
That sounds lovely. What did you do afterwards?	9
We actually exchanged some contact information and made plans to get together sometime soon.	6
That's wonderful to hear! How did you feel during the interaction?	6
Honestly, a little nervous at first since we haven't talked much before.	6
Can you tell me about one of your recent interactions with your neighbor?	6
Sure, it was two days ago. My neighbor came to visit me.	6
That’s nice. Did you invite your neighbor over or did she drop by without warning?	6
I see. What did you talk about?	6
Well, mostly about the neighborhood. I enjoyed hearing about their day and got caught up with a bit of gardening talk.	6
That sounds pleasant. Did you offer anything to your neighbor eg.tea, coffee, or a snack?	6
Yes, certainly I did, and they were so saucy trying to ask for wine	6
How's your day today?	2
Oh, it's been just the same as other days.	9
Any interesting social interaction you had today?	6
Not really. But yesterday after my regular morning walk, I stopped by my neighborhood cafe and had a little chat with the barista.	6
Oh, how was the conversation? Did you guys talked about anything interesting?	2
Interpersonal interactions like this often make for a meaningful connection. Do you regularly meet with your neighbors when you go out for your walk?	6
Pretty much. I usually meet Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins and we exchange greetings and	6
Hey there, how have things been going for you lately?	2
Not too bad, I suppose. Though something rather strange happened the other day. 	9
What happened, could you tell me more about it?	2
I was shopping at the grocery store like usual, and bumped into a neighbor I haven't seen in a while.	6
Okay, did you guys get to catch up at all? 	6
We did, for a bit anyways. I think it was a bit muddled though, I wasn't sure when to stop asking questions. So at a certain point the conversation felt like it stalled - and ultimately it turned juuuuuust a little awkward get-together just trailed off surprisingly rapidly… like I	2
Hey, it's good to see you today. How did your day go yesterday?	6
What happened?	6
Well, I had to run some errands and I found it hard to communicate with the cashier at the supermarket.	2
What was difficult about communicating?	2
Well, they spoke really fast and didn't give me much time to understand and respond. I also found it hard to hear them because of some background noises.	2
That can be frustrating. Did you manage to make the purchase and resolve the situation?	6
Yes, it took a bit longer than usual but ultimately I was able to	2
Hi there! How was your day today? 	2
Oh, it was fine. Nothing too exciting happened. 	9
Did you happen to go out and talk with anyone? 	2
Ah, I see. Where did you go to get clothes? 	2
I went to that little boutique on 4th street. They were super helpful. 	8
That's nice. How did you interact with the people working at the boutique? 	6
Oh, they were very friendly and warm and welcomed me. First, they showed me new shirts arriving the latest arriving fashion types and kindly made some recommendations based on my color	6
Hey, how are you today?	2
Oh, hello. I've had a good day, thanks.	2
That's great! What have you been up to today?	2
I had an interaction with the mail carrier today. She stopped by around noon and we had a little chat.	6
That's nice. What did you talk about?	2
Did anything interesting happen during the conversation?	9
Not really. It was just a short conversation. She's very efficient and gets about her business.	9
How did you converse? Did she talk clearly?	2
Yeah, I could hear her	2
Hey there, how's it going today?	2
Oh, you know I’m just living the retired life!	7
I understand. have you had any interactions with people that frustrated or angered you recently? 	6
Yes, my daughter called and asked for something yesterday. I agreed to do what was asked of me, but they kept interrupting while trying to explain so we could optimize function together....	6
they didn’t act respectful while talking with you or took direction well?	6
I get what you’re saying. That’s so annoying. what did you do?	6
I told X that they indeed serving me valuable stated my limit deline-cool	2
Hey, how was your day today?	2
Oh, it was good. I went to the grocery store to get some things.	5
That sounds nice. Did you talk to anyone while you were there? 	2
Yes, I asked a store employee where the milk was.	2
And how did that go? 	2
It went fine. They were polite and showed me where to find it. 	2
That's great to hear. How about yesterday, did you have any social interactions then? 	6
That's good. Did you talk about anything interesting with them?	6
Not really	9
So, have you had any interactions with people outside your family lately?	6
Yes, I went to the grocery store yesterday.	8
Oh, that's great! Did you talk to anyone while you were there?	2
Just the cashier, but it was a lovely conversation.	2
That's nice to hear. What did you talk about?	2
We chatted about the beautiful weather we've been having and how crowded the store is lately.	2
A weather chat is always a classic one! Did anyone else approach you while you were there?	2
That's understandable	2
How was your day yesterday, anything interesting happen? 	2
That sounds nice, when and how did that happen? 	2
Yeah actually there kind of like were some handful products	9
Hello, how are you doing today?	2
Doing fine.	2
Actually, I planned to visit my son's house yesterday. 	7
That's lovely! How did you end up meeting your journey?	2
I walked ten blocks down the street to take the cab. 	3
Did you have to talk to the driver and ask him where he could take you?	2
Yes, that is for sure. I had to awkwardly ask him what destinations he was heading in, and had to remember his instructions amidst that taxi noise!	2
Oh, I totally understand the hustle. It makes one’s temperature hike even higher. Well, was the journey comfortable, then	2
What did you do yesterday?	9
That's great. Do you like the people you usually meet there?	6
That sounds nice. How did you converse with her this time?	2
I asked her how her day was going and commented on the long line-up. She talked about being busy during Christmas season.	2
Wow, it's poignant that you shared an effortless conversation without meaning to buy healthier food, how was cashier's reaction	6
She fullypartpart-than verbally commended my judicious finding of alternatives	9
Friend: What are some of the events or situations that occur within your daily life that involve some sort of interpersonal interaction?	6
Friend: And how do you think you typically perform within these informal type-based interactions? Patient: My shoulders sways the joints with grace whilst my facial screws-up the worries: this portray ensures an articulation of clarity in oral and especially prompted expression such as prices pricing for nuts on a daily basis .	2
Friend: Have you found any challenges as per say dealing with strangers in your day to day looking in consideration of your age?	6
Patient: Sometimes stereotypes may lead	9
Oh dear, same like always these days.	9
Can you elaborate on what happened or what you did?	2
I went to the barbershop to trim my beard and that's the main thing I did today.	1
Did get a chance to talk with the barber? 	2
Yes, I jokingly told him about the things I must lose besides hair and finally some friends accompanied its loss over the years.	2
That's quite funny, Intacting in a jestful way helps us release tension have fun by mutually understanding some desirable insight	2
Yes indeed, it eases to wait, and meaningless chatter is strange and useless anyway.	9
Hi! How are you feeling today?	2
I'm fine, thank you for asking.	2
Well, a gentleman at the store couldn't reach the item on the top shelf and looked like he was struggling. I offered to help him and he thanked me for it, that's about it.	6
That was very kind of you. Can you tell me more about it? How did it happen?	2
He wasn't tall enough to reach the item and no one was around to help him. I was a bit hesitant at first because of social distancing rules, but I thought nothing would happen if I upper the mouth mask and helped him - keeping Social change is quite difficult these	9
Hey, how was your day?	2
Well, it was okay. Not that eventful.	9
That's ok, sometimes those types of days can be good too. Was there anything you did today that you particularly enjoyed?	2
That was great of you! How did you start a conversation with him? 	2
Hey, how was your day today?	2
Quite good, thank you. I met my neighbor today and we chatted for a while.	6
That sounds nice. Did you ask your neighbor about anything in particular?	2
Yes, I asked about her dog as he reminded me of my one who looks similar.	6
That’s a great conversation starter. Did I ever tell you about the time when I asked a stranger in a coffee shop where he got his shoes ?	2
No, please let me hear it. What happened in that shop?	2
It turned out he really liked my enthusiasm on his swag and stopped to see how I was feeling. We even finished the task of many crossword together over coffee.	6
Hi there, how was your day today?	2
It was alright, but I had a really frustrating experience at the grocery store.	7
I wasn't sure which aisle the cereal was on, so I asked a store clerk. She seemed displeased by my question and barely helped me find it on the shelf.	1
That must have been frustrating. Did you say anything to her?	2
I didn't want to cause a scene so I just reiterated that I had difficulty finding it. I think it would've been easier if she just pointed me in the right direction.	2
Did it take a while for you to find the cereal?	1
Not too long. I discovered that	9
How are you feeling today?	2
I am doing good, thank you. 	2
Great! So did you have any social interactions recently?	6
Not really, but I did something recently that I'm proud of! 	9
Well, my neighbor, who rarely speaks to me acknowledged me with a smile, and I greeted her back. Normally, she stares at everyone and just walk pass by my porch.	6
That's really nice!	6
It felt really respectful, right?	9
Absolutely! When did this happen?	9
Yesterday around seven in the morning as I step out my porch to water the plants.	9
Oh wow, that's really odd timing	9
Good evening, how did you spend your day?	9
Oh, pretty good. I received visitors this morning.	7
That's great! Who were your visitors?	6
When they visited you in the home, how did you welcome them?	2
Did they like the snack and drink you offered?	6
Yes. Her daughter was caught Looking Wide eyes to what I put May Be it's strange at seventh thats' food, but nothing spined Harm	9
How was your day today?	2
It was a little busy, actually.	1
Oh no, what kept you so busy?	2
Did you have any trouble asking for directions?	2
Oh, that must have been tough; but were you able to find your way to the pharmacy alright still?	2
Yes, the person was very patient with me and gave me a helpful explanation.	2
That's great. How about later in the day, did	9
Can you tell me about something that happened today regarding your interpersonal interactions and relationships?	6
Yeah, after I woke up, I chatted with my neighbor. 	6
Tell me more about that. How did the conversation start? 	6
I saw her cutting the grass in her front yard when I was leaving my house. I smiled and said good morning. Then, I asked her about her health because I noticed she recently where in the hospital.	6
That's very thoughtful of you. How did she respond?	6
She told me that it was serious, complication after surgery, and she appreciated me asking. I remember her mentioned that she was house-bound lately and missed attending church.	6
What did you do today?	9
I talked with my neighbor this morning.	6
Oh, nice. How did the conversation go?	6
It went okay, I just asked how they were doing and we talked about the weather for a bit.	6
That sounds wonderful. Did anything else happen in your interaction with them?	6
Well, they seemed a bit flustered and didn't really make eye contact with me when we talked.	6
Hmm, that's interesting. Have you noticed anything like that before in your interactions with them?	6
Yes, actually now that you mention it, they've always been a bit distant with me, even though we've been neighbors for a few years now.	6
That's a nice jacket you're wearing today, where did you get it? 	2
That was thoughtful of her. Have you talked to any of your other family members recently?	6
Yes, my son called me yesterday. We had a long chat about his work and his kids.	2
That must've been nice. What about your neighbors? Have you had any conversations with them recently? 	6
Actually, yes. My neighbor invited me over for a cup of tea yesterday and we had a pleasant time swapping stories. 	6
That's great to hear. What about your interactions with professionals, like doctors and nurses? Have you had any	2
Hi there, how was your day?	2
Decent outing, I had chores today.	5
What kind of chores kept your schedule jam-packed?	5
I went to med clinic early morning and then grocery shopping rest of the day.	3
It's great to hear you got your groceries brimming secure while managing rushes! Keep your positivity showered and talk to those who no longer harm or disrespect anyone B-.	6
Yes, treating others right influences people to think done like mirror-effect that ebboost their low times jointly lifting our lifespan spirits。	9
Hi there! How are you today? 	2
Oh hello. I have just been trying to tidy up my house after it was ransacked last night. 	5
Ransacked? How did that happen? 	2
Someone broke into my glass back door in the job in and from the looks of it came straight up to my small safe unlock contraption and ransacked it. 	5
I'm so sorry that happened! Who did you call for help? 	2
It took me awhile to brave calling for medical intervention, so I finally got the guild legal head in charge named *his name*''' to here me. It seemed easier that way, dear :'. 	2
How have you been, lately?	9
To be honest, it's not been easy to manage things on my own.	1
What happened?	9
Every time I try to go outside and take a walk, I become overwhelmed keeping track of everything going on around me and sometimes unclear about which way turn and look confused infront of the strangers.	3
Is there any specific event?	9
A few days ago, I needed to shop for griving parents present but lost and unable remembering which gift my parents hide to avoid spend too much in these live case. 	5
That sounds difficult. Do you have some specific grounds causing these?	9
I visited doctor since event began occurring from a few months now.	9
Hey, how's everything today?	2
Sure, what happened?	2
I went to the grocery store, and I asked an employee where to find sweet potatoes.	1
That sounds simple. Did you have any trouble asking for help?	2
No, I didn't have any problem. The employee easily helped me find it.	1
That's great to hear. Well done!	2
Also, while I was standing in the checkout line, I overheard someone behind me talking about a recipe I love making.	6
Really? What did you do after that?	2
I turned around and commented asking if he enjoys that recipe	6
So, how's your day going, sir?	2
Oh really, what happened?	2
I attempted to strike a casual conversation with my neighbor today and ended it awkwardly. 	6
I'm sorry to hear that, what happened exactly?	2
Yah, well I asked him if he had received the package I brought him due to not seeing him since then- he told me yes, with a curt tone and started to turn away towards his doorstep implying unwillingness to speak with me any longer.	6
That's unfortunate. Was he busy doing something at that time when you made conversation?	2
No, not really... that's another	9
How did your day go, have you interacted with anyone interesting today?	2
That's great! were you able to go to your destination smoothly.	2
OKaying then, how about	9
How was your day today, did anything interesting happen? 	2
Oh yes, I attended a community meeting earlier this afternoon. 	8
That sounds interesting, what did you talk about at the meeting? 	2
We were discussing the reconstruction of the city playground, several visitors had approached us regarding providing funds for more blocks for the childen to play with at recess.	8
That sounds productive. Were they strangers who approached you? 	2
Some were certainly recurrent paticipents. Most we’re regular begadian people attended. Used it as a platform to talk, really. 	8
It was! I	9
Hi there! how life's been since last time we talked?	2
Well, you know, as you get old everything slows down, and sometimes communication hasn't where I want it manages, but,hey, no worries, let me tell you about a recent event	1
Sure! Tell me more when did the event take place?	2
It was like 2 weeks ago, Just visiting my neighbor to borrow some tools for Weeding my front Lawn.	5
 What did he say? 	2
Very Welcoming lady as always open-ended scenario: she asked for what looked valuable sort of starting price for good interaction yeah from other's party - but this turned comforting small-Talk between	2
Is there something that happened today, that you want to talk about?	2
Yes, I met my friend at the park today. 	6
We’ve been friends for years now if I remember well, we met at a hobby group and realized we have similar interests.	6
What did you both do? 	9
What side of typically experiences caused a happy time them for you-two?	9
I think ? It's usually a shared friend group involved repeatedly talk	9
Hi there. How are you feeling today?	2
I am doing fine, thank you. My neighbors invited me to a party next week, so I'm looking forward to that.	6
That sounds like fun. How did they invite you to the party? 	2
They came over to my house and asked me in person if I wanted to come.	6
Oh yes, we talked about lots of things. We talked about the party, the food they're going to have, and the neighbors we both know.	2
That's great. So you felt comfortable and confident during the conversation? 	6

That sounds nice. Did you tell her what they've been up to?	2
Yes, I did. They're growing up so fast.	2
Do you often invite visitors here?	6
I bet it does. Do you ever get lonely in here?	6
Sometimes, but I try to keep busy with volunteer work and playing games with the other residents.	8
How is everything going these days?	9
Not too bad, maybe a little lonely.	6
What's been causing that?	6
Both couple friends had exciting trips planned but I didn't get an invite to either. 	6
That does sound difficult. How do those instances make you feel?	6
I kinda felt left out, like they enjoy each other's company more? 	6
Is this kind of thing usual or remarkable?	6
How do you typically cope with these kinds of situations?	9
Usually, jumping over it or distracting myself from thinking about it, a little bit of more procrastination thought.	9
So, how was your day today?	2
It has been quite nice, do you want to dictate me certain happenings such as why now and reasons for expression based one?'	0
Sure, how did you get along with your friends?	2
Oh, I just came back from meeting them at the local senior center. We talked about our life's experiences and shared stories!	6
Sounds great, did you meet any new friends?	6

F. That is fantastic to hear, how about your communication then?	2
So, did you do anything fun or new yesterday?	9
Actually, I wanted to watch this movie last night, but the seller denied the sale at the counter since I didn't remember my payment card details.	1
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! Did you end up resolving the issue and seeing the movie?	2
Thankfully, my granddaughter introduced online payment via phone apps, so I found the seller online and used the pint payments app to see it.	0
That's great that you found a solution. I'll keep taking advantange of your granddaughter' help! How did you like the movie? 	2
To be handsome, the plot was good, but damn noisy around halfway as several teagers behind,	9
Good morning! How was your day yesterday, did anything happen?	2
Well, yes, I had an encounter with Mrs. Johnson at the grocery store.	6
Ok, tell me more about that interaction.	2
Understandable. When did you mention the items you were purchasing to Mrs. Johnson?	2
To be exact? I actually eliminated them after Mrs. Johnson picked up a dozen bagels.	5
That is occasion for a scheme opener! Keep any enquiries like how many people the bagels will feed or the requested zip concentrate amount. Did you give a polite exc	2
How have things been lately, how was your day yours today?	2
It was an okay day today. But has not been that great most of the week.	7
Oh no, what happened? Is there anything that's got you troubled at the moment?	2
Well, not really anything troubling but my children haven't been picking up my calls much in the past week.	6
That is worrying! What type of calls? Are you okay? Did they reply afterwards?	2
Channeling feelings emotions towards positive responses will always herald the smooth communication methods between dynamic heterogeneous flow problems inter and intrapersonaly without mixing consequensies. Am pretty sure.	9
How was your day today?	2
It was fine, nothing much happened	9
Really? Did you talk to anybody today?	2
Yes, actually I did. I ran into my neighbor this morning.	6
Oh, that's nice! Did you exchange any words with them?	2
Yes, we talked for a little bit. We mostly just discussed the weather!	6
Ah, that's always a good topic. Did you engage in any other interactions throughout the day?	2
Well, I did make a quick stop at the store. I had to ask the cashier for some help finding a particular item I couldn't locate on my own.	2
Good for you	9
Pretty good, thanks for asking. Did something doozy happen last week that messed up a companionship. 	6
What happened? 	2
Well my neighbor and I usually exchange pleasantries and yesterday, they didn't even acknowledge me when we crossed like no one recent observed me crossing moreover they did not show impressed meeting with me. 	6
Definitely a weird experience. Maybe your neighbor was just having a bad day? 	6
I thought to let go of it at that point however the way of respite gave compleing doubts as met sometimes after hope of neighbors raising hands with greeting but on and similarly happening pulled the trigger horn of major benldowns.	9
How was your day today?	2
It wasn't bad, thank you for asking. 	2
Was there anything particular that happened?	2
I had to take a trip to the grocery store. 	5
Oh yes, I dread going on busy days. 	2
Was anyone helpful or kind to you during your trip?	2
I suppose the cashier was polite and helped bag my groceries, but I ended up throwing fruits into the backyard of their form of laziness.	5
Why did you do that?	2
They won’t be watched over all!	9
Polynomial cut up sentence, coalesced by nltk 'treeent'	9
How was your day today?	9
It was an okay day. I went to the grocery store to get some food I needed.	5
That's good. Did you interact with anyone at the store?	6
Did you offer to help her?	6
Yes, I did offer her and got her the item she was looking for.	6
That was nice of you. What about the checkout process, did you communicate with the cashier?	2
Yes, I did. The cashier greeted me and I said hi back. I thanked her at the end when I was done checking out.	2
It seems	9
How have you been feeling today?	2
Oh, just so so. Nothing too eventful happened. 	9
Well, how've things been with your family lately? 	2
Overall, it was quite synchronizing and	9
How was your day, did anything memorable happen today?	9
Oh dear, you know how visitors day went yesterday?	6
No, I wasn't informed. What exactly happened?	6
My granddaughter fell asleep half-way through meditation and I scolded her a little loudly on front of everybody... well, that's what struck with me.	6
I see. Could you have reacted differently, looking back?	6
What can I say - my pride gets the better half of me. 	6
Since you recognize that pride is affecting your relationships event negatively in your interpersonal networks, how can we pin down specific process steps to change that issue?	6
I’m really looking	9
Oh, it was fine, just like any other day.	9
Really? What did you do today?	2
Well, that’s very responsible of you to think that way. Maybe they wouldn’t mind or even be happy to let you watch.	2
Yes, maybe you’re right. I always try to be respectful and considerate of others.	9
That’s really commendable! But don’t ever lose your sense of wonder about the things around you too.	6
Oh,	9
Hi, how are you today?	2
Good, thanks for asking. How about you?	2
Well, my son came to visit me last weekend. We watched some movies together.	6
That sounds nice. Did you both enjoy it?	6
Yes, we did. It's always nice to have him around but It was a bit difficult to choose what Movie to watch as our preferences are different.	6
I can understand. Did that cause any problem between you two?	6
No, we talked through our preferences, their ratings, and found something that we both was something we hadn’t seen yet and	6
So, how has your day been so far?	2
It's been okay I guess.	2
Is there anything specific on your mind?	2
Yeah actually. Yesterday, my daughter came to visit me at the retirement home.	6
I was happy to see her of course. But some of her comments really annoyed me.	6
What kind of comments?	2
Well... She kept asking about aspects of how I live here as if she thought I'm hopeless by being passive around here.	6
How she went detail or specific expectations?, Did she explain with calm or became angry unable to understand that actions still represent responsibility?	2
Actually mostly things	9
Good morning! How has your day been so far, anything interesting to share?	6
Oh, not really. Just trying to keep up with my routine like usual, you know.	1
I know what you mean. But despite the regiments, there must come events now and then worth telling others about, right?	6
Like what, though?	9
How was your day today?	2
Oh it was alright, I had a nice chat with a neighbor this afternoon.	6
That's great to hear. Can you tell me about the conversation?	2
it looks like she's a nature lover! You've been living in this neighbourhood for a while, right?	6
Yes, I have. I feel more comfortable building connections with the people in my immediate vicinity as I see them more frequently around.	6
I can understand that. How about yesterday? Did you see your grandchild?	6
Yes, they came over for a	9
How was your day today?	2
Just okay? What did you do?	2
Well, I had a doctor's appointment this morning. Then I came home and watched some TV.	1
That sounds pretty routine. Anything happen during your appointment?	2
Not really, just a check-up. The doctor asked how I've been feeling since my last visit.	0
Did you tell them about anything that's been bothering you lately?	2
Actually, yes. I mentioned I feel like I've been more forgetful lately.	0
And what did the doctor say?	2
They did some tests and told me it's probably just a part of aging. I didn't really like	0
How's your day going so far?	2
Trouble? What happened?	2
Well, I have been trying to talk to him about something bothering me for the past few days but he never seems to listen.	6
That sounds frustrating. Did anything happen today?	2
Yeah, he completely disregarded what I was saying and walked away mid-conversation.	6
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you thought of any other approach to talk to him about your concern?	6
Yes, I plan on writing him a letter, maybe that way he will take the time to really listen to what I have to say.	2
How are you feeling today?	2
Oh, I am doing well. Just feeling a bit sluggish.	9
I see, anything interesting happen to you recently?	6
That does sound frustrating. Did it impact your phone call much?	2
Unfortunately, yes. It made interacting socially through the phone much harder and really weighed on me.	6
That makes sense. When did you start experiencing hearing issues in your phone calls?	2
It started a few weeks ago and has started progressively causing me more troubles since I am struggling in catching some of sentences from my kin eard. 	2
How has your day been?	2
Not bad, but I'm having trouble keeping in touch with people lately.	6
Oh really? Did something happen that makes it hard to stay connected?	6
Well, I think I have a little trouble sometimes understanding when someone is just busy, or when they might be ignoring me.	2
That can definitely be tough. Do you ever check in with the person and ask if everything's okay?	2
I can understand that, but sometimes it might be good to just communicate openly. That way, both parties can share their thoughts and feelings without any misunderstandings.	2
So, how's your day going, feeling any better today?	2
Yes, a little bit. As I told you last time, Rosy came over to see me today.	6
Oh, that's great to hear. Did you both had a good chat?	2
Yes, at the beginning, she told me had a rough time with work and after some talking, she confided that she had lost her grandmother recently.	6
It is terrible news; Death of a couple ones can overwhelmingly deplete.	9
P : Yes, after her words, I just held on her as she sobbed for a while.	6
But some speech may put smile; Hopefully today's reminiscing would have improve satisfactory feat of arousal.	9
Hi there, how have you been doing today?	2
That's nice to hear! Tell me a bit more about that.	2
Well I had family come visit me. It's always nice to see them, but unfortunately we had a little disagreement towards the end of their visit.	6
That's too bad. What caused the disagreement?	6
Oh it was just a small misunderstanding that got blown out of proportion. I think we just took what each other were saying the wrong way.	6
That happens sometimes. Have you talked to them since then?	6
Yes, actually. We sorted things out and came to an understanding. It turned out	6
How was your day going?	2
It was fine. Something interesting happened, though.	9
What was it?	2
Oh wow, that's not very pleasant. How did you react to that situation?	2
I noticed that she had a lot of items that shegot faster-than –usual thus seen	9
How was your day, did anything significant happen?	9
That's great, did you enjoy those interactions with your neighbors?	6
That's lovely.When you get novid,outnof your neighbourhood,how many if you interactons with lossliez ones	9
Sometimes, I avoid interactions when I feel overwhelmed. 	6
When do these interactions make you feel overwhelmed? 	6
Crowded and noisy spaces, especially when people start veering too close.	6
That makes sense. What kind of interactions do you prefer?	6
Sounds reasonable. Can you share an example of your favorite discussion topic? 	6
Not much to do these days?	9
Not really, been just staying home all the time.	5
I receive some calls from my son every week.	6
That's great, are you able to express your feelings with him? 	2
Yes, he is a good listener, empathetic too. 	2
Any shortcomings in terms of communicating with others around you? 	2
Sometimes, my neighbor creates loud noises after I stayed reminding him.	6
Oh! Are you able to avoid further escalating the situation? 	2
It took conscious efforts from my part to avoid increasing tension.	2
That seems difficult	9
Hi, how are you doing today?	2
I'm good too. So what have you been up to lately?	2
Oh, not much really. Just staying at home mostly.	9
Have you been in touch with any of your friends or family?	6
Well, my niece came to visit me the other day. We sat outside and had some tea together.	6
That sounds lovely. Do you often see your niece?	6
No, not really. She lives quite far away, so I only see her once or twice a year when she visits.	6
How did you feel about spending time with her the other day?	6
It was nice to	9
How was your morning today, did anything interesting happen? 	9
That was really kind of your neighbor. So, did you exchange words or interact at all? 	6
Well yes, but only pleasantries. We barely know each other, I really can't guess why she choose to it. 	6
It was probably out of sincere thinking. It doesn't look easy to maneuver in during this heat-wave but yet she did it. Betray of respect and friendship stance from herself. 	6
How has your day been going?	2
Oh, my day has been pretty uneventful actually. 	9
What have you done so far then? 	2
That sounds like a good circle of support to have. Do you usually regularly keep in touch with these friends? 	6
Not as much as we used to, but we catch up on occasions.	6
Yeah definitely. It sometimes is difficult now with age you know, you don't share	6
Hi, how are you feeling today?	2
I am feeling alright, thanks for asking.	2
Can you tell me how the conversations go between you and the home aide?	2
It generally goes smoothly, but there was one day where a little misunderstanding caused a conflict.	2
What happened and how did you react to the situation on that day?	2
Tell me about your day today.	9
Well, I went to the market to buy some items for my house.	5
Yes, actually I spoke with a few of the people there. 	6
Can you tell me more about that? How did you interact with them?	2
Well, I greeted the vendor who was already familiar with me. She asked how I was and commented on how she hadn't seen me in a while. We chatted briefly before I cam upon a mean looking individual. 	6
What happened there? 	9
The instant felt somber with this appearance but smiled and offered a friendly hello in	2
Hi, how are you feeling today?	2
Oh, hi there. I'm okay, just a bit tired.	2
Yeah, I can imagine. Did anything in particular happen today?	2
Yes, earlier today I went shopping for groceries at the supermarket, and I almost got into a confrontation with another shopper.	5
Well, I was standing by the dairy products, trying to decide what kind of milk to buy, and a lady came up next to me and started reaching into the fridge over my shoulder.	5
That must have been uncomfortable.	2
Yes it was. I said excuse me politely and indicated that she was bothering me. But she	2
Hi, how's everything going?	2
It's been pretty ok. I had an episode the other day at the grocery store though.	1
Can you tell me more about that?	2
Sure. I was reaching for a can of soup on the top shelf when a group of shoppers behind me started chatting pretty loudly. It startled me and made me lose my balance a bit. Before I knew it, the can slipped out of my hands and fell to the ground, making a pretty loud noise.	3
Oh, that must have been embarrassing. Did anyone help you?	2
Actually, one of the marshals walked over and offered to tone down the disposition so it doesn’t scare the others. So it all gone nicely	2
What did you buy in the market today? 	2
Mostly vegetables and some fruits. I also picked some cereals for my meals for the next few days.	5
Great! How many people did you interact with when shopping?	2
I had to interact with few people, a shopkeeper and a fellow customer who happened to be there. 	6
During the shopping, what difficult challenges did you meet dealing with people interaction or social norms?	9
Oh, nothing much actually. Except encountered a some delays	9
How are you today, can you tell me how your day has been so far? 	2
Unfortunately I usually eat alone, yeah the visits from my family definitely keep me happy whenever they visit the weekend. 	6
That's understandable, having some companies definitely lighten up life at old age. I suppose mid-day meal scenes are less interesting without betwixt matches	2
Hi there! How are you doing today?	2
Hello. I'm having an okay day I guess.	2
Is anything worrying you lately? Is anything holding you back?	2
I suppose I have this issue with inhibitions around others. I met some new friends at the communal room for coffee the other day unusually and tried to connect, ended up feeling out of place.Like I see others new which was fun. 	6
Hmm, that does sound like a difficult situation. When else have you experienced similar feelings in social situations?	2
Well, a few days ago, I went to the park and struggled to get into regular discussion with some members of baking class . Similar inhibition prevailing with touching other's Aprons	6
So, how are you doing today?	2
That is great to hear. Anything interesting happen to you recently?	2
Well, last week my grandson stopped by to visit me.	6
That sounds nice. How did you feel about that?	2

We had a great talk and he is always so attentive to me. 	6
When does he leave?	9

I bet you really appreciated the time he took to meet	6
Well, there was the day where I encountered some trouble getting around while shopping in the store.	3
Oh no, what happened?	9
That sounds frustrating, What did you do during the time you had to wait?	9
I tried to distract some little kids that were with their mother. By making silly faces at the kids and humming kids' songs, giving opportunities to the mom to relax in conversation and providing amusement for the kids and myself.	6

Well, I usually do it once a week. Saturdays suit me better.	5
Do you manage the gardening all by yourself? Such as planting, weeding? 	2
No, not exactly. My daughter helps me with that. But for watering and occasional pruning, I do it. 	5

I woke up early in the morning, it's a bit cold so I is preventing me from working in our small garden. Gardening is my everyday relaxation activity, but today, I had a difficult time using the small farming tool.	5

Do you have a usual routine before going out in the morning?	1
Yes, I usually wake up around the same time and try to move around the house to warm up my body before heading out for local mobility events.	3
And how about going to visit your grandkids who live two hours away form you. When do you take that longer , out of your area trip?	8
I do this a few times per year. But taking care of accommodating my strength criteria beforehand make me feel apprehensive.	4
How far in advance do you need to make preparations for it?	1
How was your morning today, and did you go out at all?	9
Yes dear, I went out for some shopping on my scooter. 	3
That sounds great. So when did you go shopping - in the morning? 	9
Not really dear, actually, I came back half an hour before you contacted.	9
Okay, got it. And how did your scooter function today?	3
The scooter is running still now without giving any hiccups, which is not bad at this age. But its battery depletes over time quite easily, so I charged before waking up today to avoid any breakdown and preserve its useful life. By the time I came home again in an hour, its driving capacity reduced sufficiently	3
How has your day been today?	9
Not bad. Though every day is a bit challenging as it is difficult to move around nowadays.	3
What do you mean by that? Do you need Medical assistance frequently?	9
Do you use shopping home busses for getting the grocery towards casa?	9
Yes, one fairly arrives Monday evening. However one needs placing an order Saturday or before for them to know.	5
It appears Monday the recommendation would be Better What else do you do for mobility events? 	9
Sometimes, using a highway	3
How are you feeling today?	2
I'm all right. Just a little tired.	2
Did you visit the supermarket today?	5
No, I walked to the hospital today to have my session.	3
How long do the sessions last?	0
How are you finding the walk?	1
It can be tiring but I prefer it to taking the crowded tram.	1
Do you take the tram often?	3
Yes, at least two or three times during the week.	1
How busy is the tram usually?	1
Sometimes it can be crammed. But mostly, it's a comfortable way to go around town.	1
Do you	9
Have you been out and about lately? 	8
Oh no, I rarely get the chance to go outside anymore. 	3
I just find it difficult these days. I lost some strength in my legs, so walking outside isn’t easy. 	3
That must be difficult for you. How do you usually get around? 	3
Generally, I use my scooter to get to my doctors or home services checks. 	3
And what about grocery shopping? That's also an essential activitiy, n'aest-par? 	5
Yes, I agree. On occasions my daughter helps pick up some groceries. Other times, there's this rare flyer called Maggie remarkable	9
Hi there, how have you been?	6
I've been okay, thank you. 	6
I was just wondering, how have been getting around lately? 	3
Well, I usually walk to the grocery store every Tuesday and take the bus to the library on Wednesdays. 	3
Not really, unless my daughter drives us somewhere on the weekends. 	3
That makes sense. What activities can you still participate in that requires some mobility skill? 	3
A few occasions, I ride my stationary bike as soon as I woke up and before I sleep. Cycling beat other gym equipment, it appears motions	9
How have you been, Mary? What have you been doing?	6
Hello Emily, nice seeing you today. I have been busy doing some light exercise.	1
That sounds great. What activities do you enjoy doing? 	9
Sometimes I like playing around with my cats, they love it fun.	6
Also it seems like you're in good health at that age.But airmessages@gmail conceous people who are lose mobility inevitably cannot aviod a little activity over an event.you rmtoo look good shape physicinctually. Do you face any struggles with travel in someway, wantsome earlier concepts shared each doesn't mean putting it only within season in far ranges - activities change every wet season	3
Hey, how was your weekend?	6
Oh, really? What did you end up doing? 	6
Just grocery shopping, trying so hard to get my act together nowadays.	5
That sounds like a good idea. What did you come up with afterwards? 	6
I took a cab to the pharmacy to fill up on my medication. It was a scenery rush working our way through unpaved, pouring roads while engaging gentle flights of local talk.	3
Was the cab easy to hail at that time? How did you go about it? 	3
Ordinary, made a simple package deal to get a cab quickly. Busks are quite post	9
How was your day yesterday? 	9
Not too bad. I went for a short walk around the block which gave me a chance to get outside.	3
That sounds nice. How do you usually get around to run errands, like grocery shopping?	3
Okay, and how about visiting friends or family?	6
I don't get around to see people as much anymore, but again, usually in the car when I do.	3
Makes sense. What about unexpected events like when going to a nature park or on vacation? How have you handled transportation for those occasions?	3
It's been a while since any of those happened for me. But	9
Do you have any important appointments in the next couple of days?	7
Yes, I do. 	9
That's great! How do you usually make your way there- on the bus or maybe by car? 	3
Actually, my son would come and walk with alongside me. 	6
That's nice! Is there anything new that your doctors told you that especially caused disrupting mobility for you? 	3
Makes sense. How about outpatient appointments in the clinic or visits to relatives - how're those	8
Have you been up to much today?	9
Yes, I had to take the bus to a doctor's appointment this morning.	3
That's great to hear. Did you have a specific time for the appointment?	9
Yes, it was at 10 am. So, I had to take the bus quite early this morning.	9
Oh I see. Can you tell me more about that experience taking the bus?	2
It was alright. I had to walk to the nearest bus stop and wait for about 10 minutes until the bus arrived. It was somewhat crowded, but since I had a designated seat, it was manageable sitting down for most of the ride.	3
That's reassuring. How long was the trip	9
Do you usually take the bus to grocery shop?	3
How about going to doctor appointments? How do you get there?	3
My daughter drives me there once a month for the regular check up.	3
That's helpful. How else do you get around town for other errands like going to the bank or post office?	3
To be honest, I prefer to walk when the weather is good. If not, I'll catch a cab to shorten the time.	3
Speaking of being outside, when was the last time you had a day trip or visited somebody out of town, and how did you get	8
Hi, how are you feeling today?	2
I'm doing okay - feeling a little tired.	1
Aww, sorry to hear that. Did you do anything exciting or different today?	6
I took a taxi to the park to do a little bit of walking in the sun.	3
Around mid-morning, I think. Gives me some time to settle down after breakfast,	1
Makes sense. And which taxi company did you use?	2
Which one was it, now...oh I remember - it was called Shannon Cab.	2
Great. And did you use any mobility aids - a cane or other equipment - on your	3
Do you often run errands outside your house, sir? 	3
Yes, I do. Usually every other day I have to go to the nearby ice-cream parlor where I volunteer. 	8
How do you usually go there? 	2
I go there by walking or sometimes driving my scooter named Jenny. 	3
Biking perhaps can give you more time an uncongested riding season six seasons out of every yearly horizon. Have you ever tried going on a bike to your volunteer activity? 	9
Hi there, I hope you're doing well today. Can I ask you something?	2
Of course, dear. What would you like to ask me abouut?	2
I'd like to know more about how mobility discomforts impact your life, could you elaborate a bit on that for me?	3
Oh boy, where do I start. About a month ago, I hurt my back quite badly and going back to my normal levels of groove is finally smoothing out gradually. 	3
I see. Does difficulty get in any particular time of the day?	3
usually morning, the pain generally is something I curse at few times to conclude how my next move if I've made the better call continuing till	3
Good morning! How are you feeling today, Mrs. Jenkins?	6
I am delighted. Thank you. How about you?	6
I am fine too, Mrs. Jenkins. Can I help you with anything today?	6
I am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me please when does feeling loss your energy namely breakthrough? 	2
After walking the hallway it Quite u strenuous to reach the stairs in time on these old legs.	3
That sounds frustrating, Mrs. Jenkins. How long have you experienced difficulty reaching the stairs on time?	2
At least six months from prior diminished compatibility breaking routine as to onset elapsed painful variables.	9
Hi there! How's your day going?	2
Not bad, thank you. I've been keeping quite busy! How about yourself?	2
Yeah I'm good, thanks. Have you planned anything outdoors today?	2
Actually, I did manage to make a short trip to the park earlier this afternoon.	8
That's great! How did you manage to get there?	2
I see. Is taking taxis a common way for you to get around these days?	2
Not really, but it really helps when i just want	3
How did you get here today?	3
I took the bus this morning.	3
And what about yesterday? Did you go anywhere?	3
Yes, I went to the grocery store in the morning, and later in the day I drove to a doctor’s appointment down the street.	3
How often do you take the bus or drive yourself?	3
It really depends on the day, sometimes I take the bus, but sometimes I would drive to places nearby if I feel confident.	3
That’s good to know. Do you experience any difficulty with carrying objects while you go out?	3
Have you been going out more frequently lately?	8
No, not really. I've been having more trouble with moving around.	3
Oh no, can you tell me more about that?	9
For example, every time I need to go to the grocery store, I need to take a taxi as home delivery takes too long.	3
I see. How about going to your regular doctor's appointments?	3
The bus stop is too far away from my house. Advancing for a taxi service on a punctilla basis every month would surely leave me out of budget. Sometimes my neighbor takes to me neighbor's car to see him which I really thanks	3
for doing it.	6
That's difficult. How do you usually	9
Can you tell me about how you get around throughout the day?	3
And outside of the house?	3
When I need to go shopping or run an errand, my daughter takes me.	3
Have you used public transportation before?	3
Only when my daughter isn't able, but it's been a while.	3
Which type of transportation did you use, the bus or subway?	3
Usually the bus, but it was difficult for me to get on and off.	3
Have you considered trying one of the smaller buses that cater specifically to those with mobility issues?	3
That's a good idea! Maybe I'll look into that	3
How was your day today?	2
What things did you do today?	0
I mostly just stayed home, but I did go out to pick up some groceries. 	5
How did you go to the grocery store?	2
My grandson came over and drove me there in his car. 	3
That's good to hear. Do you go out often? 	6
Not really, my staying home is shucking corn and such. 	5
But do you have the ability to ride bicycles?	3
No, It has been a while after my sone removed security - taking pedals off routinely returned them leads toworrying words but learn	9
How was your day today?	9
How did you get to the hospital?	3
My son drove me there.	3
And to the grocery store?	3
I took my walking frame to the local offer thrift  store and back,	3
Is it difficult to move around with your walking frame?	3
Well, it can be. But I've been using it for a while now, so I'm used to it.	3
Do you take any other means of transport besides your walking stride? 	3
Sometimes. For longer distances, their on	3
Hi there, how are you doing today?	2
I can understand that, with everything you have going on lately. But I'm just wondering, how have you been getting around these days?	3
Well, I'm still able to drive every once in a while, but I've noticed it's becoming more difficult to manage on my own lately. And sometimes when I need to get somewhere but I'm unable to drive, I'll have to take a bus or a taxi.	3
Those options are always available, that's great! Could you tell me where do you usually go when you ride the bus or take a	8
How was your day today?	2
Not bad. Still got some grocery shopping done. 	5
Did you reschedule for the doctor's appointments?	2
I did. Managed to catch a Cab around 10AM yesterday. Was on time otherwise I'd miss my appointment.	3
That sounds convenient. Is it your preferred mode of transport?	2
Absolutely, hassle-free, that driver knew safest and advantageous routes. Retinograph test bears stressful for me not 	9
Does that mean taking public transport too hard for you? What about trains or subways?	3
Retirement Pension facilitates without insurance scheme suffered broke buses hurled disport left of Station interiors.	9
What did you do yesterday?	9
I went to the grocery store.	5
How did you get there?	2
I walked there.	3
Was it difficult to walk there?	3
Yes, it was a bit of a challenge because it's a few blocks away and the sidewalks aren't even.	3
Have you considered driving next time?	9
Have you thought about taking the bus instead?	3
I haven't tried that, but I'm not sure which one goes to the grocery store.	9
I can look it up for you and show you which bus to take next time.	2
Oh, that would be	9
How has your week been going?	9
It's been alright, just dealing with some mobility issues.	3
Would you mind telling me more about that?	9
Sure, some days I find it really difficult to get in and out of the car.	3
When does this usually happen?	9
Have you ever thought about getting a higher car or lowering yourself into the seat using a slide board or a handrail?	3
Yes, those are both options I've considered. I've also used a mobility standing pad and it has been really helpful too.	3
Do you have any similar issues with accessing public	8

Oh interesting. How did you go about solving the problem?	2
First, I tried washing it again with more soap and a brush, but it still wasn't working. Then, I remembered seeing a cleaning product under the sink from a commercial that claimed it could tackle tough stains. So, I tried it out and it actually worked!	0
So you remembered	9
Hello there, how are you feeling today?	2

Yes, recently I am reading The Art of Memory	0
How was your day, did it go smoothly?	9
Not really, I had trouble reading the instructions on my new medicine bottle.	0
Yes, but it still looks quite blurry and an important number is out of focus.	0

That sounds like a good idea; I'll definitely do that.	2

Hi. I'm doing okay.	6

When do you experience these difficulties with lifting?	3

That's a good	9
How are you today?	2
How was your weekend?	2
That sounds like a peek at civic activities! Do you have time for volunteer?	8

What Do you usually do on Fridays?	7
Fridays, mmm, not much right now actually.	9
Was yevery Friday like this or used to you do something like meet friends or visit some place before the pandemic?	6
Unfortunately since the pandemic came over and given that I don't have my mobilty easeirly theres a shelter program from volunteer probably specially around Wednesdays where younger adults if did their community serve volunteer they got the oppportunity towards running books we talk while reading them into universial languages and listening itself so happily gives me effortful days 	8
What could keep one as lively and active members of the daily community, social, and an ordinary list of locations one steps their feet, and do to ensure regular events keep on rolling-- weekly maybe?	8
That would vary for individuals.We can look at one of these events, Like joining the church of Christ in town. And Other more varied opportunities Daily direct report volunteer schedules staying very organized too.	8
When does this occur in your week? And do think Others derive benefits beside from yourselves and at the annual sunrise charity walk?	8

Not much, actually. Just visited a used-book-turned-vintage-shop down the street and ended up chatting with some strangers for quite some time about the benefits of supporting local enterprises.	8

Yes, it's very muggy when the streets would need the passenger knee-reserve from M.	9
Will there be any development plans after the meeting?	8
What have you been up to these days?	7
Oh, just the usual things. I try to keep up with household tasks.	5
Can you tell me more about that?	9
Yeah, I rent an apartment so there's always something to arrange or fix.	5
When do you usually fix things?	5
Normally on weekends. I try to avoid asking the landlord Although fixing the problems itself is not too difficult.	5
And what about getting food and groceries?	5

Do you have City connection mean it available easily?	8
How was your day today?	2
It was fine, as usual. Though I had a problem while trying to tidy my room.	5
What happened, was it hard to clean up?	2
No actually I have been trying to properly arrange every household object in their suitable places. From upholstery curtains to appliances that suit with the colors of my rooms. Frivolous things probably. But it makes the atmosphere the way I like.	5
I see. Do you find it difficult to remember which items go with which particular colours or almost?	2
Oh not at all. Actually I just relish having an over and done with room overhaul often from fixtures to upholstery to pillows.	5
It must naguar head occuss	9

That's nice, where did you buy it from?	6
I went to a furniture store which was decently close to my house.	8
Did you rent a truck to bring it back home?	5
I paid to have it delivered. It makes things much easier having someone bring it over.	5
It took me some searching, but I found one I fell in love with. It's comfortable and feels just right.	5
That's always a good sign hesiration is cue to minimizing joy loss.	9
Choosing between	9
What do you usually do in the morning?	7
I usually wake up around 6am and brush my teeth.	4
And what about for breakfast?	5
I prefer to have some oatmeals and a cup of milk.	5
Do you do the grocery shopping by yourself or someone will assist you?	8
I usually meet with my children in the supermarket next door every Saturday afternoon to do the grocery together.	6
That'd rounded up against quality sometimes. My son and my daughter-in-law used to give a hand at cleaner activities around the house every fortnight. Yet, sometimes some soapy ointments I	5

I've been fine, thank you! How about you?	6
I'm good too. So, tell me how do you spend your daily routine?	7

How do you usually buy your groceries?	5
Normally we drive to the grocery store on Wednesdays. Sometimes, our daughter helps out and brings over some groceries for the ones we can't get locally.	5
It depends on the type of repairs which are required. Most of the certain reparis jobs, we still like to do ourselves. If it doesn't turn out working correctly. Or limited on time. If it is an excellent paramount operatations matter like exterior isolation or cleaning the structure, then I call professional estoppels in support all duties halt search not encounter unexpected complications you vernann obtain maximum finance by making research decisions sustainibility	9
So, how was your day today?	9
Ah, nothing goes too smoothly for me nowadays. Earlier this afternoon as I was mopping the kitchen floor, I slipped and fell down on the floor.	5

How often do you do the patio cleaning, any special tips to measure the frequency?	5
Once or twice a month basis Although the basic cleaning gives my garden aesthetics neatness, I notice until time to home maintenance renovations occurs is going to look ghostly when weather strikes and creeps forward on fall.	5
For home visits, aside from patio	5

Well, let me think. Oh yes! I had to change one of the lightbulbs in my living room.	5
How did that go?	9
Oh it was quite successful. Although I had little confusing, as have to reach at them and change well, I almost drooped it to the ground. Thanks god, saved.	5
Normally not very often but this one lasted just three months or so.	5
Wow, that's not too long. Do you always find it easy to replace them?	5
Well it depends on which lightbulbs need replacing. Some	5

That can be tough as chores usually vary by each day?. Alt???	5
Yes as I am getting older, I have a more difficult time completing daily tasks on my own. 	5

Mostly those tasks that require a lot of physical exerteion such as grocery shopping for restocking refrigerator. 	5
When did Shopping become to tiring? 	9

Okay. Just trying to finish the household chores.	5
Do you find it difficult to finish them in one day?	5

Sometimes, it can become a bit difficult for me to clean at certain spots where I have to bend or reach high. But my neighbor usually helps me out	6
How's your day been, do you keep yourself busy with daily household tasks?	7
That's commendable, do you take any help or you manage it all on your own?	5
Well, sometimes a people pay a kid to assist but previously finalizing after coming here had caused difficulty while setting chores as keeping me fatigue attah bay can have both enormous emotional turmoil and an extraordinarily substantive role in covering activities.	9
Yes that makes sense but anyways how do You typically groceries for the day? Order home delivery or is there any neighborhood stall that you prefer?	5
Exploring innate	9
How was your day? Did anything out of the ordinary happen?	6
My day was typical. Around lunchtime, I had to repair a leaky faucet in the kitchen sink. 	5
Was that difficult for you to manage? 	1
Not in particular. I knew how to do it and I had the necessary tools. It was just tiring to spend so much time underneath the sink. 	1
Did anything like this happen before, where you needed to fix taps or sinks? 	1
How did they	9
How was your day today?	9
Oh dear, every day just feels tedious. I suppose that's life for an old bird like me.	7
How do you deal with your daily dwelling needs like grocery shopping these days?	5
Well, these days I order my groceries online and then my grandson comes over to help unpack them and put them away.	5
How about basic cleaning around the house?	5

Yes, most of my greatest groceries I require that kind attention from a tool to cope, along with my improving difficulties mentioned	4
How has been your day, anything new happening in your routines?	7
Well, I have been feeling quite busy lately. This morning, I chose a wash-gun for my cleaning routine.	5
Indeed, it’s rarely easy to choose home furnishings with limited budget these days. I usually just go with function over appearance. This weekly home affair has been my top challenge.	5
Please do go on. Do you tale environment, scrap in here? Does following your heart serve as etnniceelement? Is quantiton as core coming to paying?	9
Thank you for your patience. Quality and affordability always dictated my appointments regarding matters	9

Like..	9
Yesterday the plumber visited after one terribly terrific agent set our upstairs house carpet, I just cannot tolerate my grey carpet turning more black every time like this.	5

How have things been around the house lately?	5
Oh, I get tired so easily. It's difficult to keep everything tidy.	4
I see. Do you have someone to help you out with errands?	5
My granddaughter comes by once a week and picks up some things such as my medicine. Other than that, no.	5
Have you thought about hiring a home aide to give you support?	5
Honestly, I'm not sure how they'd be able to guarantee whether somebody could adapt accordingmy needs. How would hiring a home aide facilitate my mundane chores differently from other people?	5
Having a person dedicated entirely to your really wants requires adjustments of mindset- but it might prove useful. Typically according their	9
Hey there, how was your week? 	9
Sounds like you had a lot of tasks to sort?	1

Oh I see- its great	9
So, how are things going at home these days? It seems like we haven't caught up in a while.	6
Well, I'm managing things one day at a time. It's hard to keep up sometimes.	1
Sure, for example, recently I tired to clean the gutters by myself and I almost fell from the ladder.	5
Oh no, when did this happen?	2
Just a few days ago. Luckily, my grandson heard me shouting for help and came running to the rescue.	6
I see. Maybe it's best to hire a professional to handle difficult tasks like that.	1
I couldn't	9
Hey there, how's everything going with you today? 	6
Oh, I'm doing just fine, thank you!	6
So, what have you been up to at home recently?	5
Well, not much lately, but I did buy some new curtains last month. 	5
Not really, it was pretty straightforward. I just went to the department store that I always go to and picked them out. 	5
Was there anything in particular you were looking for? 	5
Yes, I needed something with a lot of visual interest so that it wouldn't be too plain-looking when hanging in the window. 	5
How are you doing? I happened to be in the neighborhood and thought of stopping by.	6
Oh, that's very kind of you. I'm good. How about you?	6
I'm pretty good too. I was curious, how are you managing with cooking these days?	5
I usually try to cook every day, but sometimes, it becomes a bit challenging because I get tired quickly. So I like to prepare easy meals, or buy groceries that are convenient to cook [B NF].	5
That's understandable. And what time are you used to starting the cooking?	5
I prefer to start cooking around 3:00 pm, so the meal is ready by 6:00 pm,	5
I am a bit tired.	4
Did you get enough sleep last night?	2
No. It was hard to sleep.	4
That might be why you are feeling tired. Did you change your clothes this morning?	4
Yes, I did. It took me almost half an hour to put them on.	4
That can be a challenging part of each day. Did you follow the same steps as always?	4
Yes, but my fingers hurt, and I could not get my buttons fastened.	4
Maybe next time, you could ask someone to help lower or raise the table, which could allow you to minimize bending over near as much?	4
That could be an	9
I'm okay, been keeping myself busy	9
That's great, is it difficult getting dressed or putting clothes on?	4
Actually yes, every time I feel dizzy. But taking my time to finish dressing normally helps stabilize my body.	4
And when is the last time you experienced that unstable feeling?	9
Today while I was to tied my shoelaces	4
Oh I see. Can you usually tell when it's going to happen?	9
Often, but sometimes it feels sudden. And it's always random.	9
I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me about another challenge you may have experienced	9
Do you do any self-care events, like getting dressed in the morning?	4
That makes sense. And do you bathe yourself in the morning?	4
What about taking off clothes? Is that something you can do independently?	4
Typically, not always. Sometimes I get frustrated struggling	4
How has your day been so far?	9
Pretty good, but these days I feel so tired with normal activities. 	1

Hmm, I'm sorry to hear that. How many times a day do you need assistance?	4
Do you have any difficulties with putting on and taking off your clothes?	4
Well, I couldn't put them on by myself these days as my flexibility declined lately.	4
I see. What kind of clothings cause difficulty? 	4
Putting my pants on alone has become challenging, especially those that close over my abdomen because they require remaining upright for extended periods while doing two nonlinear motions altogether as tightly. 	4
Maybe wearing pants with elastic waistbands, elastic cylinders, or designed pockets other closings than zippers might work better.?	4
That sounds right. Though following recommending physican issued plan including exercise promoting physical endurance  build core strength so l may self-care oftentimes, maintaining a tally of constant	9
That sounds great. How do you manage to dress yourself each day?	4
That must require a good deal of skill, is assistance readily available across the sort of events?	2

Hey there, how have you been doing lately?	6
Not bad. Just trying to keep going with my daily life.	1

Not at all, what do you want to know?	6
How do you feel about getting dressed in the morning? Is it an easy task?	4
Oh, putting on my clothes is much easier than taking them off.	4
Why is that?	2
Well, to put it bluntly, I have trouble with my shoulders. I can get my shirt and pants on without much fuss but taking them off can be quite a struggle.	4
Hello! How are you feeling today ?	2
Oh, not too bad. My knee's been a bit sore today.	4
Sorry to hear that. Has it been affecting your daily routine?	1
Actually, yeah, with my sore knee I haven't been taking my phone off the charger at its usual charging spot.	1

Well, I suppose it varies. Sometimes my hands cramp up so much I struggle just to use utensils. Other times it's okay, but I have to take it slow and steady.	4
That sounds difficult. What about using cutlery? Do you have any issues there?	4

Yes, I so far have had my breakfast. 	4
Oh that's great! can you walk me through what exactly you had for breakfast? 	9
For breakfast, I had a toast with butter and a cup of coffee. 	4
Yes, I did everything by myself, I use a butter knife to put butter on the toas. 	4
That's really great. Next, after finishing your breakfast, did you drink your medicine yourself or did someone else help you?	4
How was your day, did you have a good one? 	6
It was alright, thanks. 	6
That's nice. Have you had breakfast this morning? 	4
Yes, every morning I do. 	4
What's your usual breakfast? Is there something you couldn't prepare? 	5
Today, I had oatmeal, which is something I can prepare for myself if the oats are already prepared, that is. If not, sometimes that turns into a hassle. 	5
Do you ever have trouble cutting or moulding your food on your own? Say... with forks or knives? 	4
Hey there, how was your day today?	6
It was okay, not much to mention. I had difficulties with lunchtime.	7
Lunch? what happened?	6
All I had was soup and it was too hot to eat properly.	4
Did you make it yourself or did somebody offer it poorly heated?	6
I had some leftovers from last night. I microwave it longer than usual. 	5
I noticed how well-dressed you are today! Did you get dressed by yourself this morning?	6
Indeed, I did. With little bit effort alongside some repositions may how hard walking moving can do me. I ware long- sleeve closed pajama tops with black paints.	3
That's great! Was there any difficulty in choosing clothes and buttons?	4
I see, how about taking a shower earlier at which Batiste fits your wash?	4
Maybe done such refill quickly since wants to work dress farther.	4
That's interesting. So, are meal	9
Hey, can I sit down and talk with you for a bit?	6
Sure, of course. I'd be happy to. How have you been?	6
Good, good. I've been meaning to check up on you-- how have your daily life events been?	7
Well, not so easy to manage if I'm honest, but I have someone to help out here and it solves half of it. What'd you mean exactly?	7
I wondered whether preparing something really limited your capabilities, such as cutting a rather difficult food for a packed lunch or doing meal started to demands superhuman strength.	5
Yes, there are times when food is not found easily pre-chopped , you won’t see eye-to	9
Not really, just some shopping as usual from the local grocery store and then returned home. 	5
Sounds like a routine, it's important to take care of you as well! Are you able to dress yourself in different clothes or do you stick to comfortable ones only? 	4
Well, mostly I wear gowns or outfits having large buttons due to grip issues with little experience in pairing up clothing items. 	4
That makes sense. Also, do you able to prepare your standard meals themselves sufficient in terms of health?	5
Yeah, I try my best to ensure sound balance while at having my schedule planned which nowadays focus more onto repetitive dishes come breakfast	5
Hi there, how have you been?	6
I have been okay. Just struggling with some of my daily routine activities.	4
That sounds tough. Can you give me an example?	9
Sure, well, I struggle with eating meals by myself.	4
Mostly at dinner when I am alone, some stuff can be difficult to cut and I tend to spill quite a bit of food while I eat.	4
That can be quite frustrating. Have you tried using smaller cutlery and plates previously?	9
Yeah, I have tried but they seem too awkwardsmall to hold. I am thinking about starting fingerling eating.	4
Have you consulted with your care	9
Have you been keeping up with your daily routines, like eating and dressing properly? 	4
Oh yes dear, I've been trying my best to take care of myself as well as the event this follows as well during the normal course of my day!	4
That's great to hear! Could you walk me through how your meal times look like? 	4
Well I typically take breakfast before eleven o'clock by pouring cereals neatly into a bowl beforehand with some chopped fruits of preferable suit beside trying not to fill myself too much. Also grabbing the two crystal-covered spoons waiting for use right before moving closer with a toaster readily set for cooking what always satisfies me….. FISH SANDWICHES,milk down and with mass meetings	9

I seem to struggle most with dinner. 	4
Hmm, does cuttingusing utensils cause any difficulty?	4
On occasion. But since I started using an adaptive utensil set, that helps.	4
Right, that's great. When do typically take your meals at night time?	5
Usually around 6 PM as per my patterns.	5
That makes sense. What typically gets easier about the nightly	9
Indeed, but it's getting harder to finish my meal these days. 	4
Is it because of any pain?	2
No. Maybe in my younger days, I had no problem with cutting food into smaller pieces. now with my hands slightly more firm and shaky, it's starting to become a weakness of mine.	4

That's understandable .How about bathing? Do you need assistance with that still ?	4
Yes , I have hard time managing stuff during shower and I wander in bathroom due to absence of solid grips. 	4

What kinds of things have you found difficult? 	1
You know, everyday self-care activities like eating with utensils has proven hard for me. 	4
Why is that way? 	2
Though I can usually manage scoff correctly, It's uneasy for me to manipulate with knife, forks and spoons around one hand. particularly when preparing individual parts of the dish.	4

Really? How come?	9
My hands shake a bit sometimes and it's hard to stabilize the pitcher or cup.	4

Mostly just the usual for me -- cleaning up around the house and making myself something to eat.	5
When did you start cleaning up?	1
I started in the morning before breakfast. I try to keep to a consistent routine for my housework.	5

That's nice! So, you like to maintain your eating routine every day at a particular hour. Is that right?	2
Yes, absolutely. Eating at proper times definitely sets my day straight. But to be honest, I generally have a hard time standing for long to prepare for meals independently in my kitchen.	4
That could be tough. Have you used any kitchen accessories or other useful stuff to assist you?	5
I'm really open to anything that will help me, but	9
How's your day been going, want to tell me a little about it?	6
My day has been quite nice, dear. This morning, I had an appointment with the ENT surgeon.	7
Yes, everything went well according to plan. He instructed me to modify some practicing time..	0

Every task’s operating time was oversized compared with daily lifestyle business and design everyone did stretch breaks assigned to fitness selections in replacements for settings the time situation seems standard go according that one.	9
So, how has your day been so far?	6
Well, not bad. Took me longer than usual to read the morning paper.	0
Why is that?	9
I have to hold it closer to my face to read some of the smaller print.	2
That makes sense. Do you have a magnifying glass?	2
Yes, but it's always frustrating to have to stop midway and go grab it.	1
Often just small talk with the neighbors - they're friendly and always curious to know want I've been up to.	6
And how does talking with them typically relate to your communication abilities; is it generally comfortable for you?	2

I see. And how about any other communication events you’ve had lately? Have you been texting or using any messaging apps? 	2
No, I’m not familiar with those things─ SMS technology surpassed me.	2
How's your daily communication going?	2
Oh, um, well, some parts are good I suppose.	2
Can you give an example?	2
Yes, my friend calls me most mornings to check in.	2
That's great. Is this over the phone or video chat?	2
Just on the phone. I'm not good with technology.	2

Oh, I see. How does it work? Is it easy to use?	2
Yes, it's user-friendly and we can exchange text messages or send emojis and photos as well. Moreover, we can talk for an unlimited amount of time. 	2

Not bad overall. Decent weather too.	7
What did you do while you were out and about?	7

How was the boy's communication?	2
He is such a nice chap! I had no trouble understanding him at all.	2

Do you also face to any other situation that require special treating to book or join events?	9
Yes, shopping is one tricky instance for me- following speaking conversations require lots reading lips!	2
That could be challenging when exchanging little unshown-eye customer nods. However,is the hearing aid use really common among sever se situation pro is advisable with medical advice works appropriately depend on personal habit-st routines situational practices? Do you feel like current device accommodates	2
How was your day, Mrs. Johnson?	6
Oh, it was okay. I talked to my granddaughter on the phone this morning.	6
That sounds nice. How did the conversation go?	6
Maybe you can ask her to slow down next time?	2
Yes, that's a good idea. I also had a problem communicating with my doctor during my appointment yesterday.	2
What was the issue? 	2
I can hear him just fine, but I have trouble following his accent. So some parts of the conversation are hard to understand.	2
Have you talked to the doctor about it? 	2
No,	9

I usually read the newspaper in the morning and I watch the news on TV in the evening.	0
When you're reading the newspaper, do you ever have any trouble understanding the words?	2
And when you're watching TV, do you use closed captions or sign language interpreting?	2

That's great! What about when you're talking on the phone, do you use any special devices to help with the sound or speech recognition?	2
So, how have you been doing recently. Did you do anything interesting?	6
Well, lately I have trouble hearing. The doctor advised me to use hearing aids.	2
That sounds like it could help. When do you use them?	2
During conversations and when I watch TV to make sure I catch every word.	2
How else do you communicate covertly?	2
I also rely on reading lips.	2
Thank you! I primarily use writing when electronic aids like a smartphone or tablet—that sparkle larger texts—are not fully colored symbols often confuce me.by writing stuff about them help me to clear my confusions 	2
Hey, seems like you're doing great today! How's your communication going?	2
Oh, it's going all right, not too bad today.	2
That's good to hear. I'm just curious about your daily life, when do you usually have a conversation with others?	6
Usually, I have conversations with my kids in the late evening, since they are usually busy during the day, managers too. I mostly chatter with welcoming healthcare workers around midday too sometimes. 	6
That's really interesting, how does your conversations usually go with your kids in the evening?	2
With my kids, whether we are just sharing our day activities through sign & vocal made poeple smiles no perpendicularly communicating .	2

I spent the morning talking to my son over the phone.	6
That's nice. Did you have any trouble hearing him on the phone?	2
Yes, sometimes it's difficult to understand him.	2
Have you considered using a personal amplifier when talking over the phone?	2
Yes, it works pretty well. You may want to try it.	0
That's good to know - I'll look into it. Thanks for telling me about it.	6
Sure, anytime. What else did you do today?	6
I also watched a few shows on TV - I turned on the subtitles which helped with	9
Hi there, how are you feeling today?	2
I'm doing alright, feeling a bit tired though.	9
That's understandable. So tell me, have you had any interesting conversations or discussions recently?	9
Hmm, well my neighbor came over yesterday to chat for a bit. It was nice to catch up.	6
That sounds great! Were you able to understand them easily or was it a bit difficult to follow along?	2
I'm glad to hear that. And how about conversations on the phone, do you have any issues with technology trying to communicate?	2
Well sometimes	2
Good morning! How's your day going?	2
Hi there! It's going well, thanks for asking.	2
That's great. Can you tell me about one of your typical daily routines?	7
Well, I usually wake up early in the morning and take a walk outside for some exercise and fresh air.	3
Oh, that sounds nice. Do you ever communicate with anyone while you're out there on your walk?	2
Yes, sometimes I run into my neighbors and we have a quick conversation about anything from the weather to what's new in town.	6
That's great to hear. I'm glad you're staying social. And how about when you come inside, do you make any phone calls or send	2
I called her and we had a great talk.	2
Was there anything you found stressful or difficult during the conversation?	9
No, not at all. But she talks quickly, so I had to pay attention.	2
I understand! Is this your preferred method of communication with your granddaughter or do you prefer messaging?	2
Oh, I much prefer to talk over the phone. Hearing her voice makes me happier, even though I can't see her beautiful face.	2
I see. Have you tried FaceTime or Skype to keep more in touch? 	2
I have! Especially during lockdown. She guides me through it all and it's	9
What do you usually do during the day, especially in terms of communication events?	2
Well, I usually start the day by reading the subtitles on TV.	0
Sometimes, I prefer to call my children on the phone instead of texting or emailing.	2
That sounds great! How about using social media?	2
I'm not good at that. I find it harder to navigate than other communication devices.	2
I totally understand. Do you find yourself having conversations with others often?	6
Yes, especially with the other patients here at the clinic.	6
Hmm, what about when receiving and producing messages such as written information?	2
Writing	2
Hey, how was your day today?	6
It was all right. 	9
Yeah, I was watching TV earlier and had difficulty hearing the news anchorman's voice. 	2
How do you frequently communicate with people nowadays?	2
Mostly by text and phone calls with my nephew since he's able to speak to weakl. 	2
I understand. Have you tried using any special communication device recently?	2
Well, a few days ago they lent me a goTOUCH tablet. But so far, I'm still trying to adjust to it. Heh. 	2
That's good. Do you happen to wear hearing aids or visual aids for	2
How has your day been, the day when you communicate the most?	2
Sounds very resource	9
How was your day, by the way?	6
Not bad, but my neighbor is really difficult to deal with.	6
What makes you say that?	6
Well, she's really demanding and won't give me any space.	6
Hmm, that must be frustrating. How do you usually handle it?	6
I try to avoid her as much as possible, but sometimes you can't avoid it.	6
Have you tried to talk to her about it?	6
Yes, on several occasions actually. But she seems to completely dismiss everything I say.	6
That's a good idea. I'll	9
How has your day been so far?	9
Not too bad, thank you for asking.	9
Did you do anything interesting today?	9
Yes, I was talking to my next-door neighbor.	6
oh, how was your conversation?	9
It was fine until we started talking about politics.	6
That can be a touchy subject. What happened?	9
We have different opinions and things started to intensify really fast. 	6
I tried to keep my voice low and calm down. However, we still ended up disagreeing and ending the conversation.	6
Well, handling disagreement in discussions can be a good way to practice keeping tensions low.	0
Yes,	9
What did you do yesterday, Mrs. Johnson?	7
Yesterday was a busy day for me. My neighbor asked me to water her plants while she's out of town, so I went to her house in the morning.	5
That was kind of you. Did you have a chance to interact with anyone else during the day?	6
Yes, I stopped by the supermarket on my way home. While I was standing in line I saw a lady I used to know from church, so we chatted a little bit.	6
That must have been nice to catch up with her. Were there any challenges when you were talking with the lady?	6
Well, she was asking me about some recent events in the church, but	2
It was a decent day. Nothing interesting, really.	9
I see. Well, how about yesterday? Anything noteworthy?	2
Actually, I went for a walk in the park.	3
Oh, that's nice! Did anything interesting happen while you were there?	2
There was an unruly child who was aggressively pushing past everyone on the busy footpath.	6
That must have been frustrating. How did you handle it?	2
I simply kept a safe distance and chose another path.	3
That seems like a wise decision. Anything else happen whileyouwere on your walk? 	9
Not really but did see another senior pakrer singing along with	8
I am always in the room. No one speaks with me, and I don't want to bother them.	6
That sounds difficult for you.	6
Sometimes I try to say hello to people but they seem too busy or don't hear me.	6
Has this been happening frequently?	6
Every time I leave my room, really. I am used to it.	6
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you mentioned this to anyone here before?	6
Yes, many times. But the response was always a confused look on their face and saying they will do something about it. But it never changes.	6
That must be disappointing. Have you	9
How are you feeling today?	2
That's good to hear. Tell me, have there been any events in your daily life that challenged your abilities to interact with others?	6
Yes, take yesterday for instance. I had lunch with some old buds from work after a long while being apart from them. They were joking and laughing around like before, but some of their language left me feeling left out. 	6
What kind of language did they use that impacted you negatively?	2
It seemed injurious to minority groups that I belong to, which made me feel uncomfortable joining in their exchanges so often like we did at one time	6
That must have felt	9
Hey, how was your day today? 	6
It was alright, nothing special.	7
Did any interesting interactions happen that you want to tell me about? 	6
Well, not particularly. I did go to the grocery store and the cashier was really friendly.	8
I just made small talk and smiled. They asked me how my day was going and I answered. It was a small interaction but it made me feel good. 	2
That's great. Have you been experiencing any conflict with anyone lately? 	6
Actually my grandchild and I had a little disagreement the other day. 	6
Oh no, what happened? 	6
How are things going with you?	6
Oh, hi. It's been tough these days.	7
What happened?	6
Yesterday, I went out to buy some groceries, but people seemed to block me.	3
Hmm, how is your communication with people usually like?	2
Maybe the other side has a special encounter. Did they share why this was happening?	6
No, no and sadly they refused gently sharing anything about their overall costumer-dependent principles that can be caused some authentic void about this utter dilemma.	9
F :Oh, so no comprehension occurred after composing some messages to request	2
How was your day today?	2
Oh, it wasn't bad. 	9
Did anything interesting happen?	2
Actually, yes! I talked to a friend I hadn't spoken to in awhile.	6
That's great! Why did you reach out to them now? 	6
I had been feeling pretty down lately, and I missed having conversations with them about everyday life. So, I mustered up the courage to initiate a conversation with them.	6
It went really well! My friend was super understanding and listened to everything I had to say. And even though it has been a little while since we spoke, everything felt really natural	6
I see you seem a bit down today. How has your day been, my friend?	6
Well, not bad. It's just that my nephew came to visit and things didn't go too well.	6
What happened with your nephew?	6
He wanted to eat some cookies that belonged to one of my grandchildren, but I told him they were not for him. And then we ended up arguing.	6
Oh no, that doesn't sound pleasant. How did that make you feel?	6
I feel upset. He should understand and not be simple while interacting with people staying with me. Eventually, residents of the of my caregiving require reliable assistance.	6
F& I understand. I myself find arguments hard to cope	9
How was your day today?	2
Oh, what book did you read?	2
It was a romance novel set in France.	0
That sounds interesting.. Was there anything interesting happening in the story?	2
Yes, the main character had a lot of conflict in her relationship with her boyfriend and made some bad decisions because of it.	0
How did you feel while reading those parts?	2
I can strongly relate to that kind of conflict as it often happened in my younger years when I was figuring out how to have relationships.	0
Can you think of a specific time when you had a similar conflict?	2
Sure. Around 25 years ago	9
How was your day today, hows is your social interactions going?	6
Ah, that was nice. Where you headed today?	8
Just to the neighborhood dentist which was quite fine too.	8
That sounds like a good trip. Did you talk to anyone else on the way to the office?	2
And as it always come,' I was delayed by some previous uninvited company.' Nonetheless, Misses Nancy comes around properly - you cheer up conversing giver scubadoo who sounded friendly!'	9
That's great that you found some new acquaintance and that Miss Nancy was nice to converse with.	6
Hi, how's everything going with you?	6
Well, nowadays I feel like I don't spend much time with my friends and loved ones.	6
Oh really? When did you begin to feel that way?	6
I think it started after I retired. I used to see my colleagues and old friends frequently, but now my life feels really still and lonely. My family members only call me occasionally and my old friends have moved to different cities for work.	6
Sure thing. My daughter invited her whole family to come visit for vacation this year, including grandchildren	6
How's it going today?	9
It's going alright. I had a friend come over yesterday for lunch.	6
That sounds nice. How did the visit go?	6
Well, at first it went well because my friend and I caught up. But then my friend started talking about politics and got very angry when I shared a different opinion than they did.	6
Oh, that's to be expected sometimes. How did you handle the situation?	6
I tried to calmly express my point of view, but my friend got louder and more demanding. I eventually just changed the subject to avoid further conflict.	6
I think that sounds like good conflict management.	6
Thank you. It's important to preserve the relationship,	6
It has been okay. Same routine as always.	7
Have you engaged with anyone today?	6
Yes, I met with my neighbor this morning during my walk.	6
How did the interaction go?	2
It was a brief chit chat, nothing too meaningful. 	6
Do you usually have meaningful conversations with this person? 	6
Sometimes, but today I was in a bit of a rush. 	6
That's understandable. Did you regulate your emotions while speaking with them even though you were rushing?	6
Yes, I stayed calm and courteous.	6
Hi, how was your day today?	6
Well, it was okay.	9
Did you interact with anyone today?	6
Oh yes, my neighbor stopped by to say hello.	6
That's nice! How did that go?	6
It went well as usual.	6
Did you feel comfortable interacting with them?	6
Yes, my neighbor is a pleasant person to talk to, so no problem there.	6
Sounds like things went smoothly. Is this fairly typical of your interactions with people these days?	6
That's great	9
How are you doing today?	2
I am doing okay, just a little stressed out.	2
Is everything okay with work and home?	6
I am having some trouble with my roommate. She is not respecting my wishes.	6
How so?	2
Well, I have asked her multiple times to not leave her dirty dishes in the sink but she continues to do it.	5
That must be frustrating. Have you tried talking to her and expressing how her actions are affecting you?	6
Yes, but she seems to get defensive and it becomes an argument.	6
Hmm	9
Hey! How are you today? 	2
I’m doing well, thank you. 	2
I’m glad to hear that. I noticed that you’ve been more active recently. Were there any incidents that caused you to be more outgoing? 	6
Yes actually, my daughter began taking me to dance classes at the community center! 	8
Oh that sounds fun -- How's your experience so fairment?	2
It's understandable. That	9
How was your day today, Indra?	9
Oh, that's understandable. Have you thought about reaching out to join social groups like a club?	6
Yeah, I've thought about it, but at my age, it is easy to withdraw and keep to yourself wondering the pros without really there take or implising those feasible interactions. 	6
That makes sense. Back when you used to participate in group activities, how did you interact and maintain relationships within those groups? 	6
Generally well. Those relevant social interactions were largely was dependent on memories over a period that strengthened reasonably inevitable relationships. Its easy	6
Hey, how are you feeling today?	6
I'm doing alright, thank you for asking.	6
That's good to hear. I'm always here to listen if you want to share anything.	6
Actually, I've been thinking about my interactions with my family a lot lately. It feels like every time I see them, we end up arguing about something.	6
I see. Can you give me an example of when this usually happens?	6
What have you been up to lately?	7
Not much exciting, but I went to the grocery store earlier.	5
Oh, that's good. How did interacting with the other people there go?	6
I guess it went fine. One woman let me go ahead of her in the checkout line.	6
That was nice of her. How did you respond to her?	6
I thanked her, of course, and asked how her day was going.	6
That was a friendly way to respond. Did she seem appreciative of the conversation?	6
Yes, she actually seemed a bit lonely and was really appreciative of the gesture.	6
That's good to hear. How did you feel having that conversation with	6
It was alright. 	9
is there anything that made your day unique?	2
Oh yes, my close neighbor could wander coming out carelessly troughout the appartment. it made me feel uncomfortable when she interrupt my personally activities using intrusive conversation.	6
Oh wow, when did that happen and how did you deal with it	2
this morning, i simply asked my whenif being peaceful answer signifyize Iflemate leave thanking her very quick conversation ,end.	2
Great job for standing up for yourself politely even during an uncomfortable exchange, do you normally respond to situations like that?	6
Well, most of them, usually in natural atice if indeed. Sum	9
How was your day today? Did anything noteworthy happen?	6
Ohh, well it was a decent day nothing special, just ran usual errands.	5
I actually felt really content letting a couple with kids selecting desk plates ahead of me.	6
That sounds marvelous!

sm	9
Can you tell me about something that happens in your daily life which reflects how you interact with others, like with your friends or family?	6
Well, every night, my family gets together for dinner. You could say it's our daily routine.	6
That sounds nice. How do you normally interact with your family during dinner?	6
Oh sure. During dinner, we usually talk about what happened during the day and how it was. Sometimes, my grandchildren tell stories about what is happening in the school.	6
Do you contribute to these dinner time discussions?	6
Yes. Actually, we can change our discussion about various things. Daily routine gave us different topics before.	6
How was your day? Anything special happen today?	9
Oh, it was a really lovely day. I was sitting at the park and one lady asked really nicely to share the bench. 	6
That's really nice to hear. How did you respond to her approach?	6

Oh, it has been quite busy. I had a lot of errands to run.	1
What kind of errands did you have to run?	1
Well, I went to the grocery store, picked up prescriptions at the pharmacy, and went to yoga class.	1
That sounds quite hectic. How did you manage to get everything done?	1
Sometimes it's overwhelming, but I try to prioritize what needs to be done. I make a list and work my way through it.	1
That's a good strategy! Do you often have days like this?	1
Not every day, but at my age, I have a lot of doctor's appointments and things I need	1

Sometimes I believe so. But sometimes, like I feeling little fail handling stressful mornings breakfast, remind of yesterday forgetting switching	9
How has your day been?	9
Well, not too busy, just a regular day.	9
That’s good to hear. Are there any activities you’ve carried out today that will stand out as a task performance?	1
I'm homesick so I spent a good deal of today catching up with grandkids on Zoom and FaceTime.	6
That's nice. Accomplishing any routine-reminating tasks require effort which reflects resicaliency and organizational sustainability. 	9
Yeah organizing who we're going to chat with and at what time arrange has become a pretty stragic detail in itself.	1
Right - this type manages potential hassles for task tasks refinement with accurately utilizing communication outputs does rely weel on time	2
How's your day going, anything new?	2
Why is that?	2
It's getting difficult for me to carry out this routine. I bruised myself by mistake.	4

How has your routine looked since you retired?	7
Well, when I first retired, it took a while for me to adjust but now my days usually start with a cup of coffee and some newspaper reading.	7
Usually, we go for a walk for some exercise in the morning. It tends to take up most morning. 	3

Gotcha. How about drinking, are you comfortable enough in pouring your drink?	4
Hi there, how are you doing today?	2
Not too bad, thanks for asking.	2

It’s great to hear that. How about drinking liquids? When and how do you usually have your drinks?	4
Well, I have milk with my breakfast around 7 AM. Then I have a cup of tea with a snack around 11 AM. Later in the day, I usually consume juice or water when I feel thirsty.	4
I see. Do you stir in sugar or milk in your tea as you open	4
How have you been, lately?	6
Oh, I've just been taking it day by day. The simple things are becoming harder than they used to.	7
Lately, opening bottles has been harder than usual.	4
Really. When do you usually need to open bottles?	9
I normally get very thirsty and drink several times throughout the day. But as I messed up my shoulder lately, opening a bottle of water or something hurts badly. 	4
Have you tried using other alternatives like a water filter or drinking through a straw to help with the pain?	4
I've considered it for sure. I could give a straw a go, and lately	9
Do you have trouble with self-care activities sometimes? 	4

Yeah, definitely. And then I took a long bath early and planned everyhting afterwards	4
It was alright, just the usual routine at home.	5
What does that include?	2
It includes taking care of my meals and spending time at home.	5
How is your self-care routine generally?	4
It goes alright for me. Mostly the regular activities happen like brushing my teeth, washing and dressing etc.	4
Okay and how about preparing your meals and drinks for yourself?	5
On my own I usually take bottled water, other drinks are usually ready-to-made Instant tea packs and these generally come in straw bottles easily opened.	4
That sounds easy for you. And what about preparing the foods that you had?	5
I have most of my meals	4
Oh, it was fine. I didn't do much except drink some tea this morning.	5
That sounds nice. How do you usually make your tea? 	2
Oh, my daughter usually boils water in the electric kettle, then she puts it in a teapot for me to make my tea.	5
That's convenient. Do you have difficulty pouring the tea into a cup?	4
No, not really. She usually hands it to me, top is covered so I take it without spilling.	4
I see. Do you ever use a pinch grip or use utensils such as tea strainer to scoop limited items like sugar?	4
Yes, actually my	9
So how was your day today?	6
Oh, it was a typical day really.	7
Hmm, let me think. Actually, I had a bit of trouble opening the jar of applesauce at lunch.	4
Oh no. Were you able to eventually open it or did you need some extra help?	6
After a few failed tries, I eventually got it opened by tapping it against the countertop.	4
Sounds like a handy trick.	9
Yes, I learned it a while ago. Another self-care event that has been slightly troublesome for me is pouring water into a glass without spilling them.	4
That can be tough. Are there certain times of day	9
How's your day going, my friend? Anything new happened recently about your daily behavior or schedule?	6
Well, not really, I'm pretty routine. But I just noticed that an [afternoon incident] sometimes happened since the last week. Maybe because of the hot temperatures, those incidents didn't happen?	1
What do you mean by [afternoon incident] because of hot temperatures? 	2
Have you been doing anything interesting lately, P?	9
Well, every evening around 6 pm, I make myself a cup of tea.	5
That's cool. Do you pour the hot water by yourself?	4
Yes, at first, my daughter was hesitant about it but I’ve been quite successful in not emerging hot water and doing fine at the task all alone.	4
Have you thought about adding some honey to your tea, have been exercising proactively and effectively caring of your health from before? 	4
I'm not quite confident about opening bottles and getting my prescribed medicine myself. Health is important, but I tend to almost slip up at times.	4
Maybe your doctor provided resources, the recommended dosageand	0
What did you do this morning?	7
Well, I woke up early to take a shower. It was quite hectic for me today.	4
I had some difficulties, especially with drying since my balance is not that good.	3
Oh, I understand. How aout drinking water?	4
I always make sure to bring water in a bottle with an easy-open cap around for thirsty moments. But sometimes, if it's a larger bottle ishard for me pouring water without assistance.	4
Maybe you should try to use a cup with handles, or even a straw? I find that works well, im stead I rarely open bottle caps :	4
I've never really considered using	9
Hi, how have you been?	6
Not bad thanks, just feeling a little low today. 	6
Aw I’m sorry to hear! Is there anything you’d like to chat about?	6
Not really, just having a difficult time taking care of myself lately. 	4
Few times really. When I’m stirring things like soup and coffee, with getting higher arm strength it’s quite a work to do regularly.	4
That sounds frustrating. May be just sit it on table so you don’t need to stir shots can work. And regarding self-care? Are there any specific parts you are finding troublesome	4
How are you feeling today? Any good news to share? 	2
Well, just the normal everyday routines. 	1
Oh, really? I wonder, how about your daily self-care events at home? Did you drink your coffee today or did any pouring or stirring liquids today?	4

I had trouble pouring water into a cup earlier without spilling but usually I don’t struggle with using a straw. 	3
That makes sense. Is there anything specific you find helps you keep successful with liquid use or what it helps when somebody assists you 	2
Sitting and placing the can or bottle placed inside my	9
