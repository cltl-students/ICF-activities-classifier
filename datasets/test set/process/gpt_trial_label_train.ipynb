What education did you do then?\\n8. A master's degree from the University of Rotterdam.\\n9. Did you learn a lot from that?\\n10. Yes, a lot that I can now apply in my job\\n\",\n",
       " \"1. Hi, how are you doing; are you still painting?\\n2. No, not as much as I would like\\n3. How come?\\n4. My right arm hurts a lot when I paint.\\n5. Oh that's annoying, can you do anything about it?\\n6. I'm being treated by a physiotherapist and it's getting better.\\n7. Can you express yourself creatively in any other way at the moment?\\n8. Yes, I go to museums a lot to enjoy art\\n9. Oh, that's nice\\n10. Yes, looking at art also gives me a lot of pleasure\\n\",\n",
       " \"1. Do you often meet with family when you have a day off?\\n2. Yes, we are very close as a family and I enjoy spending time with them.\\n3. Do you also go on vacation together?\\n4. Ye, we go skiing together every year\\n5. Oh nice, in our family we only see each other on birthdays\\n6. Is that okay for you guys?\\n7. Yes, we're not that close\\n8. Do you have a brother or sister?\\n9. I have a brother, but we rarely see each other.\\n10. Does your physical disability have anything to do with that?\\n11. Yes, I can't travel far and we live far away from each other\\n12. That is unfortunate\\n\",\n",
       " \"1. What do you find the most annoying household chore to do?\\n2. I find that ironing, I do that as little as possible\\n3. By buying clothes that do not wrinkle?\\n4. Yes, actually that's how I deal with it, haha\\n5. That seems like a good option to reduce the household burden\\n6. I also have a clean up worker once a week\\n7. Oh good, with what tasks is he helping you out?\\n8. Especially with cleaning the toilets and bathroom.\\n9. Oh yes, those are pretty heavy tasks that have to be done at least once a week.\\n10. Yes, because of my back problem that's a problem for me.\\n11. Does your back still hurt?\\n12. Yes, especially in tasks where I have to bend over.\\n13. Great to have help then!\\n\",\n",
       " \"1. who does the dishes in your house\\n2. well, that should be me doing the dishes\\n3. oh, why so?\\n4. oh, I suppose its kind of a tradition that the woman takes care of the dishes\\n5. can you still manage to do the dishes?\\n6. oh yes, but there is a difference compared to a couple of years ago in doing the dishes\\n7. how can you do the dishes different?\\n8. we were used to doing the dishes 3 times a day, when the kids were still at home\\n9. ah, you mean that you do the dishes not as many times as before?\\n10. yes, now sometimes don't do the dishes at all\\n11. it can become messy when you don't do the dishes, don't you think\\n12. I used to be more tidy with regard to the dishes than before, I suppose you're right\\n\",\n",

I tried to, but I did not get the chance?\\n3. what do you mean? did you not have the time or were you not able to start the conversation?\\n4. I really found it hard to start the conversation\\n5. what made it difficult to start the conversation?\\n6. I am afraid my parents will get mad at me for doing the thing\\n7. don't you think they will be more angry when they find out for themselves?\\n8. you are right, it's best to start the conversation myself\\n\",\n",

When did you notice that?\\n5. It starts around 1 year ago but it didn't affect my daily life yet. So I didn't care about it that much. However, recently, when I talked to my friends, I had to ask them to speak louder quite often so that I can hear what they said.\\n6. Have your ears ever been hurt or impaired by very loud sounds?\\n7. None that I've known of.\\n8. That might be caused by aging. It's better to have a check with your GP.\\n\",\n",

Do you have any chronic lung disease or do you smoke?\\n5. My body check shows that there are some problems, and the doctor told me to have regular checks. Emm, I have smoked for almost 40 years already.\\n6. How long have you felt difficult to get out of bed already? Do you have the same feeling every time when you get out of bed?\\n7. It's been almost 2 months, and yes, I have the same feeling almost every time.\\n\"]"
