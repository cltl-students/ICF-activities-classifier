Thanks
Did you finish your work?
Yes i did, it was quit a lot but finished for the day
Were you able to concentrate all day?
Yes, thankfully and  the new coffee machine also helped a lot
I know you have a lot of tasks, right?

I tend to just relax and sit in the sun
When driving the car, I hope you can still concentrate and leave the stress behind
I love driving, ti really takes the stress away
I want to finish my work but I did not organise my time well today
Sorry to hear, do you have the time tomorrow?
--------------------
Hey did you go running this evening?
Of course, you know I always exercise a bit after work, otherwise I feel like I  only work and do not enjoy life
I understand, I feel the same, but I like to go to the gym instead and talk to people
Well, I used to go to the gym before and I already had many friends there, but now I rather to save that money
After all, there are many different things you can do to exercise without paying a coin
That is right, I also practice yoga during the weekend in a park, if you want you can join me next time
I would love to, I love yoga and nature

I am very well, just about to go with the kids to the playground and watch them while they play
Lovely, it is a perfect day to do so!
Yes, would you care to come along? It will be fun and you can help me to keep an eye on them
Sure, great and it is always fun to see kids play and enjoy themselves
Ok lets go, do you need anything else?
No, don't think so. Let;s just hope they won't climb the high tower, I am afraid to watch them if they climb
No they won't, we can watch them from the bench in the park
--------------------
I always take a shower by myself
I sometines ask somebody to wash my back in the shower
It was so nice to dress myself for the wedding today
you look great, all dressed up!
When there is a party, I always dress in a black dress
when you dress black, that is really fancy
Because of my diabetes I have to eat on time, do you also need to eat on time?
eating in time is not that important for me
I love to carry snacks in my bag, so I can eat when I am hungry
it's a good idea to carry snacks in you bag
I definitely should drink more water
If you don't like drinking water, you can also drink tea
I know I have to look after my health, so I take my medication on time
And also, remember to look after your diet
Yes, I have had some great advice on how to manage my diet
Who gave you the advice?
I went to see a dietician and she helped me to make a plan
Sounds great, can you share the plan she gave you?
Yes sure, it is an easy plan to manage your diet and exercise
Is it a plan to balance your diet and exercise as you get older?
Yes it is, she explained how to make sure to get all the necessary intake to have enough energy for the day
And what did you learn from her?
Well, I am now eating more fruits and vegetables throughout the day
That sounds easy?
It is, and she also explained to exercise on a regular basis
What kind of exercise to you prefer to stay healthy?
I prefer to take long walks outside
Walking is a really good way to manage one's health
It is and we should plan to walk together so you can look after your health as well
Let's do so, and please share the advice of your dietician regarding a balanced diet!
--------------------
What do you find the most annoying household chore to do?
I find that ironing, I do that as little as possible
By buying clothes that do not wrinkle?
Yes, actually that's how I deal with it, haha
That seems like a good option to reduce the household burden
I also have a clean up worker once a week
Oh good, with what tasks is he helping you out?
Especially with cleaning the toilets and bathroom.
Oh yes, those are pretty heavy tasks that have to be done at least once a week.
Yes, because of my back problem that's a problem for me.
Does your back still hurt?
Yes, especially in tasks where I have to bend over.
Great to have help then!

Do you often meet with family when you have a day off?
Yes, we are very close as a family and I enjoy spending time with them.

Oh nice, in our family we only see each other on birthdays
Is that okay for you guys?
Yes, we're not that close
Do you have a brother or sister?
I have a brother, but we rarely see each other.
Does your physical disability have anything to do with that?

That is unfortunate

Did you learn a lot from that?
Yes, a lot that I can now apply in my job
--------------------
My neighbor makes loud noise during the late night quite often recently.
Then you should tell him that you are bothered by the noise.
But I have good relationship with him. I feel quite embarrased to complaint about the noise. I have been tangled with the thoughts for a few days already.
No worries, if you are friends, he will understand you.
You know, I don't quarrel with my neighbor becasue of this.
Mentally speaking, if you have thoughts and complains, you'd better express how you feel. Otherwise, it might affect your mental health.
--------------------
My friend from anti-war association and I feel quite angry about the U.S. blaming the conflicts between Ukrain and Russia.
What do you think about that?
Well, I think politians should help both sides to sit down and talk to resolve the conflict in a peaceful way. But not constantly sending weapons to make the situation worse.
But what can you do about it?
Of course there is something I can do.  Our association will hold a protest next week
How about your body situation, can you make it to the protest?
I think I am fine, as long as I control my emotion and avoid having conflicts with others.

Yes, I used to go to Prince concerts
Oh, that's fantastic, me too

who does the dishes in your house
well, that should be me doing the dishes
oh, why so?
oh, I suppose its kind of a tradition that the woman takes care of the dishes
can you still manage to do the dishes?
oh yes, but there is a difference compared to a couple of years ago in doing the dishes
how can you do the dishes different?
we were used to doing the dishes 3 times a day, when the kids were still at home
ah, you mean that you do the dishes not as many times as before?
yes, now sometimes don't do the dishes at all
it can become messy when you  don't do the dishes, don't you think
I used to be more tidy with regard to the dishes than before, I suppose you're right
--------------------
In the weekend, I love to prepare meals for myself and the family
we mostly prepare meals together in the weekend
On weekdays, I do not have much time to cook but I still manage to prepare something
I always chose simple recepies during the week
What is your favorite recipe?
I like to cook pasta with a nice veggie sause
Do you like italian food in general?

What kind of knife do you use to cut the vegetables?
I have a special knife for that, just like a pro :)

Playing sports is important for your health
Yes, but also for social reasons

Let me know if it will help you as well
It worked! I arranged for the team to meet, all done now!
Wonderful that you got it all arranged
After work, I had to drive in so much traffic
It can be so hard to drive during rush-hour and concetrate on traffiic
Today I was home with the kids, had to take them to school, go back home and find time to clean
that is quite a busy day-schedule
I was so happy to manage the energy level througout the day and was able to complete it all
Well done and happy you managed to work and concentrate the whole day
--------------------
did you talk with your parents about the thing the other day?
I tried to, but I did not get the chance?
what do you mean? did you not have the time or were you not able to start the conversation?
I really found it hard to start the conversation
what made it difficult to start the conversation?
I am afraid my parents will get mad at me for doing the thing
don't you think they will be more angry when they find out for themselves?
you are right, it's best to start the conversation myself
--------------------
did you hear about the argument in the board last night?
no, why was there an argument?
the chair took it upon him to organize stuff without informing the rest of the board
okay, that's bad. He shoul always keep them in the loop
he claimed that he did kept them in the loop, but failed to read their messages
ah, well that is a great way to start an argument. did the argument end well?
in the end the chair admitted that he might have taken more trouble to inform everyone more personal
ah, good. Did this take of the heat of the argument
almost all. They made him promis to improve is communicaton in the futre
--------------------
He, did you bike to work today?
I actually went by car because I felt tired when I woke up
I went for a long walk with the dog, in the rain. That was nice
Walking in the rain can be nice indeed
Sometimes I walk to work but that takes even longer
Walking to work is really exhausting for me
I really prefer to take the train or go by car
I usually take the bike when I go to work
Yesterday I went for a bike ride to the beach in the sun, that was lovely
lucky you! I thought there was to much wind to cycle
Do you ever go for a long bike ride to the beach?
I like taking long bike ride on the beach during sunrise
I will ride you on my bike to the bus stop today, to catch the bus to the train station
Maybe bike together to the bus? 
It has been a while since I biked but sure!
Biking can be very nice and relaxing way to exercise
True, and it is a great way to explore nature
But now with the electric bikes, it is getting more dangerous
So many people now have electric bikes!
But in traffic you have to pay more attention while biking
Yes, and to stay safe you have bike with a helmet
That is correct, biking with a helmet is much better
But I have bought a bike, and now take long rides also in the hills
Oh that is great, I do too!
We should go out more together on the bike, it will be fun!
Yes, we should! Let's plan for a activity next week
I am free next week and would love to plan a bike-ride together
Great, I will look for a nice scenic route we can take
Thanks! Looking forward
But now, I have to hurry for the bus, let's go
--------------------
getting older I notice I don't like taking the buss as easy as I did before
what wrong with taking the bus? can you not walk to the bus stop anymore?
that's allright. I can walk to the bus stop
is it difficult to climb in the bus than?
hmm, no it is also fine to climb in the bus
okay, getting there; are you able to find a seat when your in the bus?
come to think of it; it's the ticketing system in the bus that changed
why is the ticketing system a problem
the changed the buttons on the ticketing system and now I have to ask people to help me
ah, so you might need new glasses to be able to take the buss
I think I will have my eyes checked!
--------------------
are you still able to take showers?
I used to take daily showers, but lately I only take a shower once a week
How come, you don't take daily showers anymore?
due to the pain in my legs I depend on support to shower
that's to bad, do you still enjoy having a shower?
yes, very much, even though I need support and sit on a chair when showering
good to hear you are still enjoying the shower
--------------------
Do you get help in household chors
Yes.I get some help from my kids, they are teenagers now
They help me with some  of the more simple tasks
What kind of tasks do they help you with?
They help me, for example, with vacuuming
Are they also responsible for cleaning their own rooms?
Yes, they are responsible for taking care of their own room
That's helpful and also a good way to prepare themselves for doing the household on their own one day
Yes, but there are still a lot of tasks to do
Yes, true
At the moment, I learn them to wash their own clothes
That.s an easy one, since the wasking machine is doing the work
Yes, but you still can do a lot wrong haha
For exmaple, combining the white with the coloured wash
Oops!
--------------------
My wrist hurts when cooking food
Oh that's annoying, how come?
I think I have arthritis because my wrist seems thick
How does that hinder you in cooking then?
I am bothered especially when I am cutting ingredients
Have you tried cutting with a brace on your wrist?
that's a good idea, I'll give that a try
yes, I would do that, it helped me a lot when I bruised my wrist
Do you have a brace I can borrow for household chores?
Yes, I will look it up for you
many thanks!
--------------------
I've known my best friend since kindergarten
Oh, that's special; have you been close all this time?

--------------------
I feel it's difficult for me to get out of the bed recently.
Oh, why? 
I feel it's hard to breathe smoothly when I tried to get up from the bed.
Do you have any chronic lung disease or do you smoke?
My body check shows that there are some problems, and the doctor told me me to have regular checks. Emm, I have smoked for almost 40 years already.
How long have you felt difficult to get out of the bed already? Do you have the same feeling every time when you get out of the bed?
It's been almost 2 months, and yes, I have the same feeling almost every time.
--------------------
It's difficult for me to get up from the toilet recently. 
Why so? Is it because your legs are weak?
I can' tell why yet. I just feel I have to use my hands to grap something to help myself getting up.
How do you usually get up from the toilet? Do you lean your body forward and then use the strength from you feets to help yourself get up? 
I didn't pay attention to that accutually. I should try later.
Yes, you can try this method, maybe it would help.
--------------------
My kids haven't visited me for almost 2 months already.
Maybe they are busy with their work, even though they also want to visit you?
Yes, I think they quite busy and that's why I don't want to bother them.
Maybe you can have video call with them. Ask how are they recently and tell them that you miss them.
Good idea.
If you want to spent some time with them, or having dinner with them. You can just tell them your idea. Or you can invite them to your place or visit them at their places?
--------------------
Aren't you going to France this summer?
Yes, I am as a mather a fact
Have you made any progess with your French lessons?
I did, but I think I'll do better when I'll be there
Do you really speak two languages now?
I would not consider myself a natural French speaker, but I can manage to order drink
I would like to learn Spanish, I don't like to learn French though
Oh how interesting, did you already start to learn Spanish?
No, I did not start to learn another language yet, I have asked information about Spanish lesson
Really nice! When do you aim to start?
Next summer, I will start to learn Spanish, hopefully in Spain!
--------------------
Did you already decide wether you will buy another bicycle?
I have not, we are still thinking of buying e-bikes
Yes it can be a difficult process, there are so many choices to consider
So true, the offer is enormous and it makes it hard to decide
I understand! What do you still need before you can decide?
I would like to talk to people to help me decide
I could help, I have some friends with e-bikes and they already made up their minds
That would be awesome
Wait, I will give you their numbers, I  will make it much easier to decide for you!
You like to make decisions in your work?
And do you also like to make decisions about your personal life
Let me think about it for a while and come back to you
IThank you, I will think about it too!
It is quite stressful, and I can feel overwhelmed.
--------------------
Yes I did
I also send you a text message
yes, I saw that too
Did you understand the text? and how come you did not answer?
I understood you perfectly, but suppose I did not have time and forgot all about it
My phone is quite old, it is hard to communicate with it
maybe ring next time. that is always quicker
So when you call me, I might not hear you
Let's make an appointment in that case
Can you send me a text message if you want to tell me something
I will send you a spoken message instead
Otherwise you can try to call but I mights not answer
In that case I will take another turn
Today I was in a Zoom meeting with my team, I still can not believe how well it works
For me, it becomes more difficult to understand all these communication possibilites
I can imagine, the developments of possibilities to communicate have increased so much
I have bought an Iphone  but you have to help me understand how to use it
Sure! I would love to show and help you out
Can you show me how it works on yours?
I will later today
I heard from a friend that these phone can also make great photo's these days!
Yes they do, but we should not forget how important face-to-face communication is
I agree, I have a hard time to understand all the communication on a phone?
So you prefer to talk face-to face?
Yes I do, but I am willing to learn all the new options to communicate!
That is great, especially on your age
THanks! Talk later, I will call you with my new phone!
--------------------
yesterday I drove 1400 miles by car, which is almost a personal record!
Wauw! I can imagine your were fatigued when you got home
I should be fatigued after this drive, but I went straight into the gym
that's tough! were you able to exercise after such a long drive?
exercising was hard after the drive, but it did help me to get my blood circling
so you felt refreshed after the exercises
yes, I would recomend everyone to perform exercises after long drives
--------------------
lately stair climbing is becoming more tiresome
how come stairclimbing is more intens than it was before
I have been in the hospital recently and lost some weight
that might be a good explanation for a deteriorating physical fitness. Dit recieve any rehabilitation afterwards?
no I did not, because I never had trouble climbing the stairs
It might be a good idea to start exercising and strengthen your muscles for stair climbing
I thought taking more walk outside. Do you think that helps for stair climbing as well
in general you should be able to walk stairs if you take daily walks
--------------------
do you still do your own groceries?
yes I do take my own groceries, but I am alway very tired when I get home
howcome the groceries make you tired?
the groceries seem to get havier by the month
is your fitness deteriorating do you think?
why would my fitness get any worse? I just as active as always
when getting older your muscles will get less strong unless you perform exercises
so you think my groceries are not getting havier, but I am getting less strong
yes, you might want to consider strength exercises to be able to do your groceries getting less fatigued
--------------------
I clean the house every day, do you do the same?
We clean the house only on weekends.
Sometimes we also have to help my mother with tasks
Does she need a lot of help
Only for window cleaning and other heavy tasks
It can be difficult to help others and take care of your own household at the same time.
Yes, a double household is quite tiring.
Does your husband also lend a hand
Yes, he takes out the trash cans, but as far as I'm concerned he could do a little more
Familiar problem, haha
--------------------
when I got out of bed this morning I almost slipped
oh really, why did you slip?
not sure, I think my head was clear yet and I got up to fast
ooh, that is understandable, you should whatch out when getting up at your age
not funny, I never have trouble getting out of bed before
did anything change recently?
come to think of it, I did start medication recently and on the disclosure I read dissyness could be a side effect
a, well; there is you explanation than for nearly slipping!
--------------------
Do you have time for dinner on Friday?
Well, I usually am a bit busy on Friday and finish working at 19:00

That sounds like a busy schedule, Don't you have lunch at one point?
Yes, I have lunch after my meetings and then take a break with my colleagues
After I go back to the office and work on my project until five when i have to leave and pick up my dog at the pet salon

I couldn't mop the floor like how I did before anymore.
I am sorry to hear that, but why?
I could mop the floor of the whole appartement before. But now, I get pain in my waist already after mopping just the living room floor. I can not bend my waist for a long while anymore.
True, bending for a long time will cause excessive load on your waist. Do you need to do any other chores or movement that will require you to bend your waist for a long time?
I also did quite some gardening recently. Maybe that also hurt my waist.
It might be. You'd better take a rest for a few days and avoid bending your waist. Even if you need to bend your waist, you 'd better just keep it for just a really short while. And if you still have the pain, it's necessary to visit the doctor.
--------------------

It's been almost 3 months.
Did you get injured 3 months before?
Nope.
After walking for how long or how far would your right thigh start feeling weak?
Half an hour or one kilometers somthing like that.
--------------------
How do you interact with your neighbors?
We greet each other when we meet, but that's all.
And do you help each other when necessary?
Yes, we can always ask our neighbors for help.
That's important, it's not always like that.
No, in big cities you can live very anonymously
People can get lonely
Yes, promoting contacts in the neighborhood can be important when people are in need of help
Do you know of any projects that try to improve contacts in the neighborhood?
Yes, I know of some; for example, a project where elderly people and students interact and do things for each other
That's a very good initiative!
--------------------
 Do you go to church on Sunday?
I only go to church when I feel up to it
I find the social part in our church community an important aspect
How do mean?
I mean, people really care for eachother 
That must bring a lot of support and comfort to people
yes, especcially to the vulnerable people in our community
Does the city you live in also provide support for these people, outside the church
yes, i sometimes help as a volunteer 
What do you do then?
I bring people to the hospital for example or help them to organize their finances
Oh, very good!

I feel it's difficult for me to hear things clearly nowadays. 
Hello, Hello. Can you hear me?
Sure, but if you are 5 meters away from me, then it's difficult.
When did you notice that?
It starts around 1 year ago but it didn't affect my daily life yet. So I didn't care about it that much. However, recently, when I talked my friends, I had to ask them to speak lounder quite often so that I can hear what they said.
Have your ear ever been hurt or impaired by very loud sounds?
None that I've known of.
That might be cause by aging. It's better to have a check with your GP.
--------------------
I'm having difficulty speaking lately. Can you help me?
What seems to be the trouble when you speak?
I have difficulty in saying what I am thinking. 
do you know in your head what you want to say?
yes, I can see the words in front of me, but when I speak my mouth hesitates
there seems to be a motor problem and willl refer you to a speach therapist
--------------------
when you spoke to Ed eysterday, did he mention he was happy?
I did speak to Ed, but he did not seem happy
that is odd, he called me to say hey got good grades on his finals
ah, great! we only spoke about his grandparents and the are ill. So, no reason to be cheerfull
okay, that explains it. if you see him next time congratulate him with his grades!
I will sure do, that might cheer him up
--------------------
Did you do something interesting today?
Not really, I just went to work in the morning and had a couple of meetings in the morning
Well, meetings can also be fun sometimes. But how was your day overall?
It was good after the meeting I helped a colleague with an interesting task and then went to get a coffe
Then went back to my office to work on the code and finish a document for my supervisor
Sounds like a very productive day, did you do something else to relax after work?
Well, after work I was hungry so I decided to make dinner and work a bit on my personal project
Seems like you had a lot to do today, I hope you can relax next days
I also went to work and after I went swimming before coming home to relax
Sounds like we had a busy and productive day, good for us
--------------------
I invest my money, do you?
Yes, I do but I don't take much risk
I only take risk with a small portion of my savings
What do you invest in then?
I invest in crypto's
Oh yes, that market is quite uncertain
Yes, but in the longer term I think it will go in the right direction
Is it the future according to you?
yes, I expect a lot from it
Then let's hope those expectations come true
