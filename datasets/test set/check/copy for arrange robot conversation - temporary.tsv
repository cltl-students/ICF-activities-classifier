He can you do some groceries after work?	He, did you bike to work today?
I will do so, but first I need to finish my work	I actually went by car because I felt tired when I woke up
OK, I will talk to you later about dinner	I went for a long walk with the dog, in the rain. That was nice
Thanks	Walking in the rain can be nice indeed
Did you finish your work?	Sometimes I walk to work but that takes even longer
Yes i did, it was quit a lot but finished for the day	Walking to work is really exhausting for me
Were you able to concentrate all day?	I really prefer to take the train or go by car
Yes, thankfully and  the new coffee machine also helped a lot	I usually take the bike when I go to work
I know you have a lot of tasks, right?	Yesterday I went for a bike ride to the beach in the sun, that was lovely
Yes thats what made it so busy	lucky you! I thought there was to much wind to cycle
What do you do when the stress gets too much?	Do you ever go for a long bike ride to the beach?
I tend to just relax and sit in the sun	I like taking long bike ride on the beach during sunrise
When driving the car, I hope you can still concentrate and leave the stress behind	I will ride you on my bike to the bus stop today, to catch the bus to the train station
I love driving, ti really takes the stress away	Maybe bike together to the bus? 
I want to finish my work but I did not organise my time well today	It has been a while since I biked but sure!
Sorry to hear, do you have the time tomorrow?	Biking can be very nice and relaxing way to exercise
--------------------	True, and it is a great way to explore nature
Were you not able to concentrate that well today?	But now with the electric bikes, it is getting more dangerous
I was not able to concentrate, even though I made a schedule with tasks	So many people now have electric bikes!
That is a great idea! I will make one to for my work	But in traffic you have to pay more attention while biking
Let me know if it will help you as well	Yes, and to stay safe you have bike with a helmet
It worked! I arranged for the team to meet, all done now!	That is correct, biking with a helmet is much better
Wonderful that you got it all arranged	But I have bought a bike, and now take long rides also in the hills
After work, I had to drive in so much traffic	Oh that is great, I do too!
It can be so hard to drive during rush-hour and concetrate on traffiic	We should go out more together on the bike, it will be fun!
Today I was home with the kids, had to take them to school, go back home and find time to clean	Yes, we should! Let's plan for a activity next week
that is quite a busy day-schedule	I am free next week and would love to plan a bike-ride together
I was so happy to manage the energy level througout the day and was able to complete it all	Great, I will look for a nice scenic route we can take
Well done and happy you managed to work and concentrate the whole day	Thanks! Looking forward
--------------------	But now, I have to hurry for the bus, let's go
Hey did you go running this evening?	--------------------
Of course, you know I always exercise a bit after work, otherwise I feel like I  only work and do not enjoy life	getting older I notice I don't like taking the buss as easy as I did before
I understand, I feel the same, but I like to go to the gym instead and talk to people	what wrong with taking the bus? can you not walk to the bus stop anymore?
Well, I used to go to the gym before and I already had many friends there, but now I rather to save that money	that's allright. I can walk to the bus stop
After all, there are many different things you can do to exercise without paying a coin	is it difficult to climb in the bus than?
That is right, I also practice yoga during the weekend in a park, if you want you can join me next time	hmm, no it is also fine to climb in the bus
I would love to, I love yoga and nature	okay, getting there; are you able to find a seat when your in the bus?
Great, see you next weekend then? we usually meet at 10:00	come to think of it; it's the ticketing system in the bus that changed
Perfect, then I can go there after breakfast	why is the ticketing system a problem
See you	the changed the buttons on the ticketing system and now I have to ask people to help me
--------------------	ah, so you might need new glasses to be able to take the buss
Do you have time for dinner on Friday?	I think I will have my eyes checked!
Well, I usually am a bit busy on Friday and finish working at 19:00	--------------------
Oh, maybe we can meet after work, but tell me what do you usually do on Friday?	What did you study?
I wake up early to have breakfast and then go to the office, once I am at the office I have meeting until 13:00	I studied law, but went in a completely different direction
That sounds like a busy schedule, Don't you have lunch at one point?	So what are you doing now?
Yes, I have lunch after my meetings and then take a break with my colleagues	I have done additional courses focused on management in healthcare
After I go back to the office and work on my project until five when i have to leave and pick up my dog at the pet salon	Oh, and do you work in that now?
Oh wow, he is a lucky dog. But he can come with us to have dinner if you want	Yes, my courses led to a management job in healthcare
That would be great, in that sense I do not have to bring him home and we can meet at 19:00	What education did you do then?
--------------------	A master's degree from the University of Rotterdam.
Did you do something interesting today?	Did you learn a lot from that?
Not really, I just went to work in the morning and had a couple of meetings in the morning	Yes, a lot that I can now apply in my job
Well, meetings can also be fun sometimes. But how was your day overall?	--------------------
It was good after the meeting I helped a colleague with an interesting task and then went to get a coffe	are you still able to take showers?
Then went back to my office to work on the code and finish a document for my supervisor	I used to take daily showers, but lately I only take a shower once a week
Sounds like a very productive day, did you do something else to relax after work?	How come, you don't take daily showers anymore?
Well, after work I was hungry so I decided to make dinner and work a bit on my personal project	due to the pain in my legs I depend on support to shower
Seems like you had a lot to do today, I hope you can relax next days	that's to bad, do you still enjoy having a shower?
I also went to work and after I went swimming before coming home to relax	yes, very much, even though I need support and sit on a chair when showering
Sounds like we had a busy and productive day, good for us	good to hear you are still enjoying the shower
--------------------	--------------------
Hey, how are you today	Do you get help in household chors
Have you been reading in your new book?	Yes.I get some help from my kids, they are teenagers now
I'm good. Thank you. Yes I have been reading my new book acutally	They help me with some  of the more simple tasks
were you able to read all day?	What kind of tasks do they help you with?
No not really. I had to put it down a few times due to my headaches	They help me, for example, with vacuuming
I have not read in years due to headaches but now I can read again	Are they also responsible for cleaning their own rooms?
And are you glad you are reading again?	Yes, they are responsible for taking care of their own room
Yes, very glad, it is so relaxing	That's helpful and also a good way to prepare themselves for doing the household on their own one day
And what do you like to read most?	Yes, but there are still a lot of tasks to do
A good thriller is really my favorite genre	Yes, true
--------------------	At the moment, I learn them to wash their own clothes
Aren't you going to France this summer?	That.s an easy one, since the wasking machine is doing the work
Yes, I am as a mather a fact	Yes, but you still can do a lot wrong haha
Have you made any progess with your French lessons?	For exmaple, combining the white with the coloured wash
I did, but I think I'll do better when I'll be there	Oops!
Do you really speak two languages now?	--------------------
I would not consider myself a natural French speaker, but I can manage to order drink	My wrist hurts when cooking food
I would like to learn Spanish, I don't like to learn French though	Oh that's annoying, how come?
Oh how interesting, did you already start to learn Spanish?	I think I have arthritis because my wrist seems thick
No, I did not start to learn another language yet, I have asked information about Spanish lesson	How does that hinder you in cooking then?
Really nice! When do you aim to start?	I am bothered especially when I am cutting ingredients
Next summer, I will start to learn Spanish, hopefully in Spain!	Have you tried cutting with a brace on your wrist?
--------------------	that's a good idea, I'll give that a try
Did you already decide wether you will buy another bicycle?	yes, I would do that, it helped me a lot when I bruised my wrist
I have not, we are still thinking of buying e-bikes	Do you have a brace I can borrow for household chores?
Yes it can be a difficult process, there are so many choices to consider	Yes, I will look it up for you
So true, the offer is enormous and it makes it hard to decide	many thanks!
I understand! What do you still need before you can decide?	--------------------
I would like to talk to people to help me decide	I've known my best friend since kindergarten
I could help, I have some friends with e-bikes and they already made up their minds	Oh, that's special; have you been close all this time?
That would be awesome	No, we lost track of each other for a while
Wait, I will give you their numbers, I  will make it much easier to decide for you!	How come you got back together?
You like to make decisions in your work?	I moved to the same town where she lives
And do you also like to make decisions about your personal life	It must be nice to have her around again?
Let me think about it for a while and come back to you	Yes, it feels familiar
IThank you, I will think about it too!	I can imagine; I have that with a friend too
It is quite stressful, and I can feel overwhelmed.	We can easily meet up when we want to see each other
--------------------	Yes, that's really an advantage!
He, do you fancy going to watch a football match in the stadium tonight?	--------------------
Yes I would love too, it has been ages since I watched a match	Do you go to trainings for your work?
Do you know who is playing?	With us it is all training on the job and by doing
No I don't, but I dont' mind I just really like to go	What kind of training it it?
I will pick you up, I will take two more friend to see the match as well	It's mainly project management and sales
We are not going with just the two of us?	In what area do you like to develop yourself?
No we are not	I would like some more education in leadership skills
Than I prefer to stay home and watch a good movie on tv	Do you plan to do a course? 
Do you prefer to see a movie on TV over a match?	Yes, I am about to ask my boss 
Yes, if we are not going with just us I do	It would be great if you can start soon!
--------------------	Yes, I am always in for learning new skills
Goodmorning! How are you?	--------------------
I am very well, just about to go with the kids to the playground and watch them while they play	I feel it's difficult for me to get out of the bed recently.
Lovely, it is a perfect day to do so!	Oh, why? 
Yes, would you care to come along? It will be fun and you can help me to keep an eye on them	I feel it's hard to breathe smoothly when I tried to get up from the bed.
Sure, great and it is always fun to see kids play and enjoy themselves	Do you have any chronic lung disease or do you smoke?
Ok lets go, do you need anything else?	My body check shows that there are some problems, and the doctor told me me to have regular checks. Emm, I have smoked for almost 40 years already.
No, don't think so. Let;s just hope they won't climb the high tower, I am afraid to watch them if they climb	How long have you felt difficult to get out of the bed already? Do you have the same feeling every time when you get out of the bed?
No they won't, we can watch them from the bench in the park	It's been almost 2 months, and yes, I have the same feeling almost every time.
--------------------	--------------------
Yes I did	It's difficult for me to get up from the toilet recently. 
I also send you a text message	Why so? Is it because your legs are weak?
yes, I saw that too	I can' tell why yet. I just feel I have to use my hands to grap something to help myself getting up.
Did you understand the text? and how come you did not answer?	How do you usually get up from the toilet? Do you lean your body forward and then use the strength from you feets to help yourself get up? 
I understood you perfectly, but suppose I did not have time and forgot all about it	I didn't pay attention to that accutually. I should try later.
My phone is quite old, it is hard to communicate with it	Yes, you can try this method, maybe it would help.
maybe ring next time. that is always quicker	--------------------
So when you call me, I might not hear you	Hi, how are you doing; are you still painting?
Let's make an appointment in that case	No, not as much as I would like
Can you send me a text message if you want to tell me something	How come?
I will send you a spoken message instead	My right arm hurts a lot when I paint.
Otherwise you can try to call but I mights not answer	Oh that's annoying, can you do anything about it?
In that case I will take another turn	I'm being treated by a physiotherapist and it's getting better.
Today I was in a Zoom meeting with my team, I still can not believe how well it works	Can you express yourself creatively in any other way at the moment?
For me, it becomes more difficult to understand all these communication possibilites	Yes, I go to museums a lot to enjoy art
I can imagine, the developments of possibilities to communicate have increased so much	Oh, that's nice
I have bought an Iphone  but you have to help me understand how to use it	Yes, looking at art also gives me a lot of pleasure
Sure! I would love to show and help you out	--------------------
Can you show me how it works on yours?	My kids haven't visited me for almost 2 months already.
I will later today	Maybe they are busy with their work, even though they also want to visit you?
I heard from a friend that these phone can also make great photo's these days!	Yes, I think they quite busy and that's why I don't want to bother them.
Yes they do, but we should not forget how important face-to-face communication is	Maybe you can have video call with them. Ask how are they recently and tell them that you miss them.
I agree, I have a hard time to understand all the communication on a phone?	Good idea.
So you prefer to talk face-to face?	If you want to spent some time with them, or having dinner with them. You can just tell them your idea. Or you can invite them to your place or visit them at their places?
Yes I do, but I am willing to learn all the new options to communicate!	--------------------
That is great, especially on your age	Aren't you going to France this summer?
THanks! Talk later, I will call you with my new phone!	Yes, I am as a mather a fact
--------------------	Have you made any progess with your French lessons?
I'm having difficulty speaking lately. Can you help me?	I did, but I think I'll do better when I'll be there
What seems to be the trouble when you speak?	Do you really speak two languages now?
I have difficulty in saying what I am thinking. 	I would not consider myself a natural French speaker, but I can manage to order drink
do you know in your head what you want to say?	I would like to learn Spanish, I don't like to learn French though
yes, I can see the words in front of me, but when I speak my mouth hesitates	Oh how interesting, did you already start to learn Spanish?
there seems to be a motor problem and willl refer you to a speach therapist	No, I did not start to learn another language yet, I have asked information about Spanish lesson
--------------------	Really nice! When do you aim to start?
did you talk with your parents about the thing the other day?	Next summer, I will start to learn Spanish, hopefully in Spain!
I tried to, but I did not get the chance?	--------------------
what do you mean? did you not have the time or were you not able to start the conversation?	Did you already decide wether you will buy another bicycle?
I really found it hard to start the conversation	I have not, we are still thinking of buying e-bikes
what made it difficult to start the conversation?	Yes it can be a difficult process, there are so many choices to consider
I am afraid my parents will get mad at me for doing the thing	So true, the offer is enormous and it makes it hard to decide
don't you think they will be more angry when they find out for themselves?	I understand! What do you still need before you can decide?
you are right, it's best to start the conversation myself	I would like to talk to people to help me decide
--------------------	I could help, I have some friends with e-bikes and they already made up their minds
when you spoke to Ed eysterday, did he mention he was happy?	That would be awesome
I did speak to Ed, but he did not seem happy	Wait, I will give you their numbers, I  will make it much easier to decide for you!
that is odd, he called me to say hey got good grades on his finals	You like to make decisions in your work?
ah, great! we only spoke about his grandparents and the are ill. So, no reason to be cheerfull	And do you also like to make decisions about your personal life
okay, that explains it. if you see him next time congratulate him with his grades!	Let me think about it for a while and come back to you
I will sure do, that might cheer him up	IThank you, I will think about it too!
--------------------	It is quite stressful, and I can feel overwhelmed.
did you hear about the argument in the board last night?	--------------------
no, why was there an argument?	Do you often meet with family when you have a day off?
the chair took it upon him to organize stuff without informing the rest of the board	Yes, we are very close as a family and I enjoy spending time with them.
okay, that's bad. He shoul always keep them in the loop	Do you also go on vacation together?
he claimed that he did kept them in the loop, but failed to read their messages	Ye, we go skiing together every year
ah, well that is a great way to start an argument. did the argument end well?	Oh nice, in our family we only see each other on birthdays
in the end the chair admitted that he might have taken more trouble to inform everyone more personal	Is that okay for you guys?
ah, good. Did this take of the heat of the argument	Yes, we're not that close
almost all. They made him promis to improve is communicaton in the futre	Do you have a brother or sister?
--------------------	I have a brother, but we rarely see each other.
He, did you bike to work today?	Does your physical disability have anything to do with that?
I actually went by car because I felt tired when I woke up	Yes, I can't travel far and we live far away from each other
I went for a long walk with the dog, in the rain. That was nice	That is unfortunate
Walking in the rain can be nice indeed	--------------------
Sometimes I walk to work but that takes even longer	Yes I did
Walking to work is really exhausting for me	I also send you a text message
I really prefer to take the train or go by car	yes, I saw that too
I usually take the bike when I go to work	Did you understand the text? and how come you did not answer?
Yesterday I went for a bike ride to the beach in the sun, that was lovely	I understood you perfectly, but suppose I did not have time and forgot all about it
lucky you! I thought there was to much wind to cycle	My phone is quite old, it is hard to communicate with it
Do you ever go for a long bike ride to the beach?	maybe ring next time. that is always quicker
I like taking long bike ride on the beach during sunrise	So when you call me, I might not hear you
I will ride you on my bike to the bus stop today, to catch the bus to the train station	Let's make an appointment in that case
Maybe bike together to the bus? 	Can you send me a text message if you want to tell me something
It has been a while since I biked but sure!	I will send you a spoken message instead
Biking can be very nice and relaxing way to exercise	Otherwise you can try to call but I mights not answer
True, and it is a great way to explore nature	In that case I will take another turn
But now with the electric bikes, it is getting more dangerous	Today I was in a Zoom meeting with my team, I still can not believe how well it works
So many people now have electric bikes!	For me, it becomes more difficult to understand all these communication possibilites
But in traffic you have to pay more attention while biking	I can imagine, the developments of possibilities to communicate have increased so much
Yes, and to stay safe you have bike with a helmet	I have bought an Iphone  but you have to help me understand how to use it
That is correct, biking with a helmet is much better	Sure! I would love to show and help you out
But I have bought a bike, and now take long rides also in the hills	Can you show me how it works on yours?
Oh that is great, I do too!	I will later today
We should go out more together on the bike, it will be fun!	I heard from a friend that these phone can also make great photo's these days!
Yes, we should! Let's plan for a activity next week	Yes they do, but we should not forget how important face-to-face communication is
I am free next week and would love to plan a bike-ride together	I agree, I have a hard time to understand all the communication on a phone?
Great, I will look for a nice scenic route we can take	So you prefer to talk face-to face?
Thanks! Looking forward	Yes I do, but I am willing to learn all the new options to communicate!
But now, I have to hurry for the bus, let's go	That is great, especially on your age
--------------------	THanks! Talk later, I will call you with my new phone!
when I got out of bed this morning I almost slipped	--------------------
oh really, why did you slip?	yesterday I drove 1400 miles by car, which is almost a personal record!
not sure, I think my head was clear yet and I got up to fast	Wauw! I can imagine your were fatigued when you got home
ooh, that is understandable, you should whatch out when getting up at your age	I should be fatigued after this drive, but I went straight into the gym
not funny, I never have trouble getting out of bed before	that's tough! were you able to exercise after such a long drive?
did anything change recently?	exercising was hard after the drive, but it did help me to get my blood circling
come to think of it, I did start medication recently and on the disclosure I read dissyness could be a side effect	so you felt refreshed after the exercises
a, well; there is you explanation than for nearly slipping!	yes, I would recomend everyone to perform exercises after long drives
--------------------	--------------------
yesterday I drove 1400 miles by car, which is almost a personal record!	lately stair climbing is becoming more tiresome
Wauw! I can imagine your were fatigued when you got home	how come stairclimbing is more intens than it was before
I should be fatigued after this drive, but I went straight into the gym	I have been in the hospital recently and lost some weight
that's tough! were you able to exercise after such a long drive?	that might be a good explanation for a deteriorating physical fitness. Dit recieve any rehabilitation afterwards?
exercising was hard after the drive, but it did help me to get my blood circling	no I did not, because I never had trouble climbing the stairs
so you felt refreshed after the exercises	It might be a good idea to start exercising and strengthen your muscles for stair climbing
yes, I would recomend everyone to perform exercises after long drives	I thought taking more walk outside. Do you think that helps for stair climbing as well
--------------------	in general you should be able to walk stairs if you take daily walks
lately stair climbing is becoming more tiresome	--------------------
how come stairclimbing is more intens than it was before	do you still do your own groceries?
I have been in the hospital recently and lost some weight	yes I do take my own groceries, but I am alway very tired when I get home
that might be a good explanation for a deteriorating physical fitness. Dit recieve any rehabilitation afterwards?	howcome the groceries make you tired?
no I did not, because I never had trouble climbing the stairs	the groceries seem to get havier by the month
It might be a good idea to start exercising and strengthen your muscles for stair climbing	is your fitness deteriorating do you think?
I thought taking more walk outside. Do you think that helps for stair climbing as well	why would my fitness get any worse? I just as active as always
in general you should be able to walk stairs if you take daily walks	when getting older your muscles will get less strong unless you perform exercises
--------------------	so you think my groceries are not getting havier, but I am getting less strong
getting older I notice I don't like taking the buss as easy as I did before	yes, you might want to consider strength exercises to be able to do your groceries getting less fatigued
what wrong with taking the bus? can you not walk to the bus stop anymore?	--------------------
that's allright. I can walk to the bus stop	I clean the house every day, do you do the same?
is it difficult to climb in the bus than?	We clean the house only on weekends.
hmm, no it is also fine to climb in the bus	Sometimes we also have to help my mother with tasks
okay, getting there; are you able to find a seat when your in the bus?	Does she need a lot of help
come to think of it; it's the ticketing system in the bus that changed	Only for window cleaning and other heavy tasks
why is the ticketing system a problem	It can be difficult to help others and take care of your own household at the same time.
the changed the buttons on the ticketing system and now I have to ask people to help me	Yes, a double household is quite tiring.
ah, so you might need new glasses to be able to take the buss	Does your husband also lend a hand
I think I will have my eyes checked!	Yes, he takes out the trash cans, but as far as I'm concerned he could do a little more
--------------------	Familiar problem, haha
I always take a shower by myself	--------------------
I sometines ask somebody to wash my back in the shower	Hey, how are you today
It was so nice to dress myself for the wedding today	Have you been reading in your new book?
you look great, all dressed up!	I'm good. Thank you. Yes I have been reading my new book acutally
When there is a party, I always dress in a black dress	were you able to read all day?
when you dress black, that is really fancy	No not really. I had to put it down a few times due to my headaches
Because of my diabetes I have to eat on time, do you also need to eat on time?	I have not read in years due to headaches but now I can read again
eating in time is not that important for me	And are you glad you are reading again?
I love to carry snacks in my bag, so I can eat when I am hungry	Yes, very glad, it is so relaxing
it's a good idea to carry snacks in you bag	And what do you like to read most?
I definitely should drink more water	A good thriller is really my favorite genre
If you don't like drinking water, you can also drink tea	--------------------
I know I have to look after my health, so I take my medication on time	He can you do some groceries after work?
And also, remember to look after your diet	I will do so, but first I need to finish my work
Yes, I have had some great advice on how to manage my diet	OK, I will talk to you later about dinner
Who gave you the advice?	Thanks
I went to see a dietician and she helped me to make a plan	Did you finish your work?
Sounds great, can you share the plan she gave you?	Yes i did, it was quit a lot but finished for the day
Yes sure, it is an easy plan to manage your diet and exercise	Were you able to concentrate all day?
Is it a plan to balance your diet and exercise as you get older?	Yes, thankfully and  the new coffee machine also helped a lot
Yes it is, she explained how to make sure to get all the necessary intake to have enough energy for the day	I know you have a lot of tasks, right?
And what did you learn from her?	Yes thats what made it so busy
Well, I am now eating more fruits and vegetables throughout the day	What do you do when the stress gets too much?
That sounds easy?	I tend to just relax and sit in the sun
It is, and she also explained to exercise on a regular basis	When driving the car, I hope you can still concentrate and leave the stress behind
What kind of exercise to you prefer to stay healthy?	I love driving, ti really takes the stress away
I prefer to take long walks outside	I want to finish my work but I did not organise my time well today
Walking is a really good way to manage one's health	Sorry to hear, do you have the time tomorrow?
It is and we should plan to walk together so you can look after your health as well	--------------------
Let's do so, and please share the advice of your dietician regarding a balanced diet!	Hey did you go running this evening?
--------------------	Of course, you know I always exercise a bit after work, otherwise I feel like I  only work and do not enjoy life
do you still do your own groceries?	I understand, I feel the same, but I like to go to the gym instead and talk to people
yes I do take my own groceries, but I am alway very tired when I get home	Well, I used to go to the gym before and I already had many friends there, but now I rather to save that money
howcome the groceries make you tired?	After all, there are many different things you can do to exercise without paying a coin
the groceries seem to get havier by the month	That is right, I also practice yoga during the weekend in a park, if you want you can join me next time
is your fitness deteriorating do you think?	I would love to, I love yoga and nature
why would my fitness get any worse? I just as active as always	Great, see you next weekend then? we usually meet at 10:00
when getting older your muscles will get less strong unless you perform exercises	Perfect, then I can go there after breakfast
so you think my groceries are not getting havier, but I am getting less strong	See you
yes, you might want to consider strength exercises to be able to do your groceries getting less fatigued	--------------------
--------------------	What do you find the most annoying household chore to do?
are you still able to take showers?	I find that ironing, I do that as little as possible
I used to take daily showers, but lately I only take a shower once a week	By buying clothes that do not wrinkle?
How come, you don't take daily showers anymore?	Yes, actually that's how I deal with it, haha
due to the pain in my legs I depend on support to shower	That seems like a good option to reduce the household burden
that's to bad, do you still enjoy having a shower?	I also have a clean up worker once a week
yes, very much, even though I need support and sit on a chair when showering	Oh good, with what tasks is he helping you out?
good to hear you are still enjoying the shower	Especially with cleaning the toilets and bathroom.
--------------------	Oh yes, those are pretty heavy tasks that have to be done at least once a week.
are still doing your own household	Yes, because of my back problem that's a problem for me.
oh yes, I still do part of my own household	Does your back still hurt?

well, I take dust every wednesday, and the beds on friday	Great to have help then!
okay, great that you are still able to do your own bed	--------------------
yes, we do the beds together with my husband. he helps when I ask	Goodmorning! How are you?
ah, and who does the vacuum cleaning?	I am very well, just about to go with the kids to the playground and watch them while they play
vacuum cleaning is usely his job, when I water the plants	Lovely, it is a perfect day to do so!
good to hear that you collaborate with your husband in doing the household	Yes, would you care to come along? It will be fun and you can help me to keep an eye on them
are their any tasks in the household for which you need external support	Sure, great and it is always fun to see kids play and enjoy themselves
oh yes, once a week we get the help who takes care of the major things in the household	Ok lets go, do you need anything else?
ah, you mean window cleaning and or mopping	No, don't think so. Let;s just hope they won't climb the high tower, I am afraid to watch them if they climb
yes, for mopping and window cleaning we need help, but all other stuff concerning the household we do ourselves	No they won't, we can watch them from the bench in the park
--------------------	--------------------
who does the dishes in your house	I always take a shower by myself
well, that should be me doing the dishes	I sometines ask somebody to wash my back in the shower
oh, why so?	It was so nice to dress myself for the wedding today
oh, I suppose its kind of a tradition that the woman takes care of the dishes	you look great, all dressed up!
can you still manage to do the dishes?	When there is a party, I always dress in a black dress
oh yes, but there is a difference compared to a couple of years ago in doing the dishes	when you dress black, that is really fancy
how can you do the dishes different?	Because of my diabetes I have to eat on time, do you also need to eat on time?
we were used to doing the dishes 3 times a day, when the kids were still at home	eating in time is not that important for me
ah, you mean that you do the dishes not as many times as before?	I love to carry snacks in my bag, so I can eat when I am hungry
yes, now sometimes don't do the dishes at all	it's a good idea to carry snacks in you bag
it can become messy when you  don't do the dishes, don't you think	I definitely should drink more water
I used to be more tidy with regard to the dishes than before, I suppose you're right	If you don't like drinking water, you can also drink tea
--------------------	I know I have to look after my health, so I take my medication on time
I clean the house every day, do you do the same?	And also, remember to look after your diet
We clean the house only on weekends.	Yes, I have had some great advice on how to manage my diet
Sometimes we also have to help my mother with tasks	Who gave you the advice?
Does she need a lot of help	I went to see a dietician and she helped me to make a plan
Only for window cleaning and other heavy tasks	Sounds great, can you share the plan she gave you?
It can be difficult to help others and take care of your own household at the same time.	Yes sure, it is an easy plan to manage your diet and exercise
Yes, a double household is quite tiring.	Is it a plan to balance your diet and exercise as you get older?
Does your husband also lend a hand	Yes it is, she explained how to make sure to get all the necessary intake to have enough energy for the day
Yes, he takes out the trash cans, but as far as I'm concerned he could do a little more	And what did you learn from her?
Familiar problem, haha	Well, I am now eating more fruits and vegetables throughout the day
--------------------	That sounds easy?
Do you get help in household chors	It is, and she also explained to exercise on a regular basis
Yes.I get some help from my kids, they are teenagers now	What kind of exercise to you prefer to stay healthy?
They help me with some  of the more simple tasks	I prefer to take long walks outside
What kind of tasks do they help you with?	Walking is a really good way to manage one's health
They help me, for example, with vacuuming	It is and we should plan to walk together so you can look after your health as well
Are they also responsible for cleaning their own rooms?	Let's do so, and please share the advice of your dietician regarding a balanced diet!
Yes, they are responsible for taking care of their own room	--------------------
That's helpful and also a good way to prepare themselves for doing the household on their own one day	What do you find the most annoying household chore to do?
Yes, but there are still a lot of tasks to do	I find that ironing, I do that as little as possible
Yes, true	By buying clothes that do not wrinkle?
At the moment, I learn them to wash their own clothes	Yes, actually that's how I deal with it, haha
That.s an easy one, since the wasking machine is doing the work	That seems like a good option to reduce the household burden
Yes, but you still can do a lot wrong haha	I also have a clean up worker once a week
For exmaple, combining the white with the coloured wash	Oh good, with what tasks is he helping you out?
Oops!	Especially with cleaning the toilets and bathroom.
--------------------	Oh yes, those are pretty heavy tasks that have to be done at least once a week.
What do you find the most annoying household chore to do?	Yes, because of my back problem that's a problem for me.
I find that ironing, I do that as little as possible	Does your back still hurt?
By buying clothes that do not wrinkle?	Yes, especially in tasks where I have to bend over.

Does your back still hurt?	Is that okay for you guys?
Yes, especially in tasks where I have to bend over.	Yes, we're not that close
Great to have help then!	Do you have a brother or sister?
--------------------	I have a brother, but we rarely see each other.
In the weekend, I love to prepare meals for myself and the family	Does your physical disability have anything to do with that?
we mostly prepare meals together in the weekend	Yes, I can't travel far and we live far away from each other
On weekdays, I do not have much time to cook but I still manage to prepare something	That is unfortunate
I always chose simple recepies during the week	--------------------

My wrist hurts when cooking food	Yes, a lot that I can now apply in my job
Oh that's annoying, how come?	--------------------
I think I have arthritis because my wrist seems thick	My neighbor makes loud noise during the late night quite often recently.
How does that hinder you in cooking then?	Then you should tell him that you are bothered by the noise.
I am bothered especially when I am cutting ingredients	But I have good relationship with him. I feel quite embarrased to complaint about the noise. I have been tangled with the thoughts for a few days already.
Have you tried cutting with a brace on your wrist?	No worries, if you are friends, he will understand you.
that's a good idea, I'll give that a try	You know, I don't quarrel with my neighbor becasue of this.
yes, I would do that, it helped me a lot when I bruised my wrist	Mentally speaking, if you have thoughts and complains, you'd better express how you feel. Otherwise, it might affect your mental health.
Do you have a brace I can borrow for household chores?	--------------------
Yes, I will look it up for you	My friend from anti-war association and I feel quite angry about the U.S. blaming the conflicts between Ukrain and Russia.
many thanks!	What do you think about that?

I have some good friends I hang out with on the weekends, and you?	But what can you do about it?
Yes, me too; I like to sit by the campfire on weekends with friends.	Of course there is something I can do.  Our association will hold a protest next week
With music and good conversations for sure?	How about your body situation, can you make it to the protest?

Which part of the leg feels weak? Your thighs or your claves? On the left side or on the right side? 	Sure, but if you are 5 meters away from me, then it's difficult.
The right side. It feels like it happens on my thigh.	When did you notice that?
When did you start feeling it's weak?	It starts around 1 year ago but it didn't affect my daily life yet. So I didn't care about it that much. However, recently, when I talked to my friends, I had to ask them to speak louder quite often so that I can hear what they said.
It's been almost 3 months.	Have your ears ever been hurt or impaired by very loud sounds?
Did you get injured 3 months before?	None that I've known of.
Nope.	That might be caused by aging. It's better to have a check with your GP.
After walking for how long or how far would your right thigh start feeling weak?	--------------------
Half an hour or one kilometers somthing like that.	I see some colleagues as friends
--------------------	Do you also see them outside of work?

It occurs when I climb the stairs or when Istand up from a squat.	Yes, we spend a lot of time at work, don't we?

Oh, why? 	My right arm hurts a lot when I paint.

When did you notice that?	And do you still do that?
It starts around 1 year ago but it didn't affect my daily life yet. So I didn't care about it that much. However, recently, when I talked my friends, I had to ask them to speak lounder quite often so that I can hear what they said.	No, not for a long time, actually only at Christmas
Have your ear ever been hurt or impaired by very loud sounds?	Have you found another way to believe?

It's difficult for me to get up from the toilet recently. 	Yes, there are some important messages in it that help me in life
Why so? Is it because your legs are weak?	Yes, for me it's important too
I can' tell why yet. I just feel I have to use my hands to grap something to help myself getting up.	--------------------
How do you usually get up from the toilet? Do you lean your body forward and then use the strength from you feets to help yourself get up? 	Do you manage your finances well?
I didn't pay attention to that accutually. I should try later.	I have trouble managing my finances after my resignition

--------------------	we saved money to buy a car last year
I couldn't mop the floor like how I did before anymore.	I am happy I can provide for myself financially because I work
I am sorry to hear that, but why?	My wife has a really good job and is able to provide for the house
I could mop the floor of the whole appartement before. But now, I get pain in my waist already after mopping just the living room floor. I can not bend my waist for a long while anymore.	Since the energy costs increased immensely....
True, bending for a long time will cause excessive load on your waist. Do you need to do any other chores or movement that will require you to bend your waist for a long time?	Yes, life is expensive at the moment
I also did quite some gardening recently. Maybe that also hurt my waist.	Do you spend your money on holidays?
It might be. You'd better take a rest for a few days and avoid bending your waist. Even if you need to bend your waist, you 'd better just keep it for just a really short while. And if you still have the pain, it's necessary to visit the doctor.	Yes, I do but I go camping this year because hotels are way to expensive
--------------------	Okay, yes can imagine
My neighbor makes loud noise during the late night quite often recently.	--------------------
Then you should tell him that you are bothered by the noise.	I got a head rush quite often recently.
But I have good relationship with him. I feel quite embarrased to complaint about the noise. I have been tangled with the thoughts for a few days already.	How does the head rush normally happen?
No worries, if you are friends, he will understand you.	It occurs when I climb the stairs or when Istand up from a squat.
You know, I don't quarrel with my neighbor becasue of this.	How stong does it feel?
Mentally speaking, if you have thoughts and complains, you'd better express how you feel. Otherwise, it might affect your mental health.	Sometime, I feel like I cannot stand steadily and have to hold something to support myself.
--------------------	How long does it take to recover from the rush?
My kids haven't visited me for almost 2 months already.	Around half a minute, somthing like that.
Maybe they are busy with their work, even though they also want to visit you?	Did you measure you blood pressure recently?
Yes, I think they quite busy and that's why I don't want to bother them.	Nope
Maybe you can have video call with them. Ask how are they recently and tell them that you miss them.	Maybe we should first mesure your blood pressure.
Good idea.	--------------------
If you want to spent some time with them, or having dinner with them. You can just tell them your idea. Or you can invite them to your place or visit them at their places?	I couldn't mop the floor like how I did before anymore.
--------------------	I am sorry to hear that, but why?
My friend from anti-war association and I feel quite angry about the U.S. blaming the conflicts between Ukrain and Russia.	I could mop the floor of the whole appartement before. But now, I get pain in my waist already after mopping just the living room floor. I can not bend my waist for a long while anymore.
What do you think about that?	True, bending for a long time will cause excessive load on your waist. Do you need to do any other chores or movement that will require you to bend your waist for a long time?
Well, I think politians should help both sides to sit down and talk to resolve the conflict in a peaceful way. But not constantly sending weapons to make the situation worse.	I also did quite some gardening recently. Maybe that also hurt my waist.
But what can you do about it?	It might be. You'd better take a rest for a few days and avoid bending your waist. Even if you need to bend your waist, you 'd better just keep it for just a really short while. And if you still have the pain, it's necessary to visit the doctor.
Of course there is something I can do.  Our association will hold a protest next week	--------------------
How about your body situation, can you make it to the protest?	How is your education going?
I think I am fine, as long as I control my emotion and avoid having conflicts with others.	I am too tired to study well at the moment
--------------------	Oh,that's annoying. How long has it been bothering you?
	Since I had a COVID infection 10 months ago.
	Did you pass any exams during that period?
	I've only passed one out of five.
	Have you applied for an extension ?
	Yes, that application is now pending
	I hope you can resume your education soon and start feeling better
	Yes, thank you!
	--------------------
	how do you feel recently?
	Nothing wrong, except that my legs feels weak every time after a long walk.
	Which part of the leg feels weak? Your thighs or your claves? On the left side or on the right side? 
	The right side. It feels like it happens on my thigh.
	When did you start feeling it's weak?
	It's been almost 3 months.
	Did you get injured 3 months before?
	Nope.
	After walking for how long or how far would your right thigh start feeling weak?
	Half an hour or one kilometers somthing like that.
	--------------------
	How do you interact with your neighbors?
	We greet each other when we meet, but that's all.
	And do you help each other when necessary?
	Yes, we can always ask our neighbors for help.
	That's important, it's not always like that.
	No, in big cities you can live very anonymously
	People can get lonely
	Yes, promoting contacts in the neighborhood can be important when people are in need of help
	Do you know of any projects that try to improve contacts in the neighborhood?
	Yes, I know of some; for example, a project where elderly people and students interact and do things for each other
	That's a very good initiative!
	--------------------
	 Do you go to church on Sunday?
	I only go to church when I feel up to it
	I find the social part in our church community an important aspect
	How do mean?
	I mean, people really care for eachother 
	That must bring a lot of support and comfort to people
	yes, especcially to the vulnerable people in our community
	Does the city you live in also provide support for these people, outside the church
	yes, i sometimes help as a volunteer 
	What do you do then?
	I bring people to the hospital for example or help them to organize their finances
	Oh, very good!
	--------------------
	I feel it's difficult for me to hear things clearly nowadays. 
	Hello, Hello. Can you hear me?
	Sure, but if you are 5 meters away from me, then it's difficult.
	When did you notice that?
	It starts around 1 year ago but it didn't affect my daily life yet. So I didn't care about it that much. However, recently, when I talked my friends, I had to ask them to speak lounder quite often so that I can hear what they said.
	Have your ear ever been hurt or impaired by very loud sounds?
	None that I've known of.
	That might be cause by aging. It's better to have a check with your GP.
	--------------------
	I'm having difficulty speaking lately. Can you help me?
	What seems to be the trouble when you speak?
	I have difficulty in saying what I am thinking. 
	do you know in your head what you want to say?
	yes, I can see the words in front of me, but when I speak my mouth hesitates
	there seems to be a motor problem and willl refer you to a speach therapist
	--------------------
	when you spoke to Ed eysterday, did he mention he was happy?
	I did speak to Ed, but he did not seem happy
	that is odd, he called me to say hey got good grades on his finals
	ah, great! we only spoke about his grandparents and the are ill. So, no reason to be cheerfull
	okay, that explains it. if you see him next time congratulate him with his grades!
	I will sure do, that might cheer him up
	--------------------
	Did you do something interesting today?
	Not really, I just went to work in the morning and had a couple of meetings in the morning
	Well, meetings can also be fun sometimes. But how was your day overall?
	It was good after the meeting I helped a colleague with an interesting task and then went to get a coffe
	Then went back to my office to work on the code and finish a document for my supervisor
	Sounds like a very productive day, did you do something else to relax after work?
	Well, after work I was hungry so I decided to make dinner and work a bit on my personal project
	Seems like you had a lot to do today, I hope you can relax next days
	I also went to work and after I went swimming before coming home to relax
	Sounds like we had a busy and productive day, good for us
	--------------------
	I feel it's difficult for me to get out of bed recently.
	Oh, why?
	I feel it was hard to breathe smoothly when I tried to get up from the bed.
	Do you have any chronic lung disease or do you smoke?
	My body check shows that there are some problems, and the doctor told me to have regular checks. Emm, I have smoked for almost 40 years already.
	How long have you felt difficult to get out of bed already? Do you have the same feeling every time when you get out of bed?
	It's been almost 2 months, and yes, I have the same feeling almost every time.
	--------------------
	I invest my money, do you?
	Yes, I do but I don't take much risk
	I only take risk with a small portion of my savings
	What do you invest in then?
	I invest in crypto's
	Oh yes, that market is quite uncertain
	Yes, but in the longer term I think it will go in the right direction
	Is it the future according to you?
	yes, I expect a lot from it
	Then let's hope those expectations come true
