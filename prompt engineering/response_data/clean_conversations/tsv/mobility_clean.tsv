Oh sure. Getting in and out of bed. It's become quite a hassle as I’ve gotten older.
That sounds difficult. Could you describe how you do it?
First, I sit on the edge of the bed and lean forward a bit, then I put both hands on the mattress carefully. After that, I use both feet to push on the ground, while I’m pushing up with my hands rollingswinging momentarily towards the siden where the floor is. Finally,again I push some more until my seat completely overtop of my edge of bed. 
That must take a lot out of you. When do you

I seem to be doing all right with everything, but some things require a little bit more planning and effort on my part these days.
Of course, life changes as we age, there's nothing to be ashamed of in needing extra help. What types of things need a little bit more consideration these days?
Well, anytime that I have to go up or down the stairs especially with a cane, the struggle becomes real for me. I try

How do you manage to get out of bed each morning?
I first try to turn over and sit up before finally swinging out my legs from the bed.
That sounds hard, do you have someone to help you?
Thankfully no, it would be embarrassing if somebody always needed to help me.
How about getting in and out of chairs as well as walking from one side of the room to another?

It's been alright, just feeling a bit tired today.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it because of any trouble with moving around throughout the day?
A little bit, actually. I've been having some difficulty with getting up from sofas or chairs sometimes.
I see. Can you tell me a bit more about when it usually occurs and how it feels for you?

I see, when is it hardest for you to stand up?
Mostly during mornings and after long periods of rest.
And how about maintaining standing for awhile?
Oh usually when I need to make sandwiches or do dishes lately.
Understandable. When sitting for the longer duration, is there any difficulty then?
No, sitting for awhile doesn't give me an issue.
That makes sense. How are transfers when you move from bed to chair or when you drop something and selecting it off
--------------------
How is your day going so far?
It's been alright so far, thank you.
Have you had to do any particularly mobility-intensive tasks today?
Yes, actually. I had to get up from my chair quite a few times to grab things from different parts of the room.
When was the first time you had to get up?
I got up about an hour ago to make myself breakfast. Standing there for too long wasn't great for my knees.
I see. And have you had to transfer yourself anywhere?
I generally try to only go from my chair to my bed as my hip tends to act up a lot after walking distances or too often.

Yes, it's been challenging. I find it hard to lift heavy things.
When do you experience these difficulties with lifting?
It happens mainly in the morning when I try to carry groceries from the shop.
Is there anything specific that led to these challenges?
Maybe it's because I'm getting old because it was never this hard trying to carry morning groceries.
Would you say that abdominal lifts are just as difficult?' 
No, abdominal lifts have
--------------------
Hi there, how's your day going?
Not too bad, a little tired from the morning activities.
What sort of activities did you do this morning?
Well, I woke up and got dressed by walking to the closet for my clothes. I then made breakfast, which involved reaching for a bowl and pouring cereal. I also have to prop up a chair against the wall to give me a place to rest among other things.
That sounds like quite a few different tasks that require mobility. Is there any particular one that you find more challenging than the others?
 P: Well, sometimes carrying groceries can be difficult even when it's not that far of a walk.
I can see how that

How are you today?
Oh, not bad. And yourself?
I'm great, thanks for asking. Could you tell me what you did yesterday?
Of course, I woke up early in the morning and got myself out of my bed.
How do you manage to do that? 
I use the bed rail to pull myself upright then turn my legs to rest them down on the floor.
Shower or have breakfast yet? 
Not yet. Usually, I put my pull up the bed because is because more comfy to get onto it after a shower but last day I jdecided onto maOnt be on Upwing over my Pull Ups tightly so that it would stay on

--------------------
Do you do any lifting or carrying in your daily life? 
Yes, I have to carry groceries whenever I go grocery shopping. 
That's understandable, how frequently do you go grocery shopping in a week? 
I go two times a week. 
I see. During those groceries to reach your place, would you walk carrying or pushing a rolling cart for your purchases? 
Usually, I carry them until the cart becomes vacant and I put every item there then commence walking by pushing them.
How often do you find yourself kicking any specific object on a regular basis while, for example, you are standing, waiting around, or during leisure activities like playing ball?
Actually
--------------------
Do you feel comfortable with your mobility on a daily basis? 
Yes and no. Although I can still walk, but I can't do some things by myself anymore. 
What kind of activities do you find difficult? 
Well, lifting any weight is out of the question. And I can no longer kick a ball. 
When did you first start to notice these limitations? 
I suppose it's only been around the last year or two? Came on slowly with being unable to do small things and then got worse. 
Do you give piggyback rides to your grandchildren?

Yes, I do some simple exercises to stretch and move my arms and legs while reading the morning news.
What do you do for your breakfast later?

--------------------
How was your day today?
Not too bad, but I had trouble carrying my groceries upstairs.
What happened? Did you drop something?
No, I just found it difficult to carry the bags up by myself. It's getting harder by the day.
Have you tried using a shopping cart or asking someone for help?
Yeah, I have a cart, but when it comes to the stairs, I just can't maneuver it on my own. And there's no one around to help me.
I see. How about your daily walks?
It's going okay, but I slow down at times and also take more stops than I would like.
Are there specific types
--------------------
Hey! How have you been spending your days?
Not very active since I had an accident a while ago.
Oh no, I'm really sorry to hear that. Does it impact your mobility functions as well?
Yes, I struggle especially with carrying items up the stairs.
Oh, so you have to carry things often at your living place. How frequently you need to handle it per day?
Daily, because there is no elevator, even though I restarted fitness moments ago with help.
That can be a lot to manage. Can I ask if there's any assistance that provided through worker or family?
Sometimes my sister helps me carry baguals but after her bedtime, nobody
--------------------
Hi there, how was your day going so far?
Oh, it's been okay. A little exhausting.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything in particular that's making it more exhausting?

I can relate to that. Could you tell me more about it? Like, when does it usually happen and how do you feel when it does?
Sure. Usually it'll start a little while after I've been doing something. For example this morning it was while I was cleaning my table. Just gripping and moving some

I'm doing ok, Thanks for asking.
Can you tell me what did you do yesterday?
Well, let me think...oh, in the morning, I had difficulty walking to the restroom because it's quite far.
Why was it?
It took me a while because my knee joint persisted pain from standing too much, and plus it was a bit swollen in the morning.

Bending my knee made it tough, which I have to do once to safely get off of the bed and when I walk over the handhold under the ceiling row
--------------------
What kind of activities do you usually do at home that involve movement?
Well, I like to garden in the yard when the weather is nice.
That's great! What type of movements do you perform when gardening?
I often have to crouch down to fully engage with the soil, and I use a lot of upper and lower body strength to lift heavy things like bags of soil.
Do you need to use any tools to assist you with your gardening?
Yes, when the yard requires significant upkeep post-autumn there are a lot of leavesstemsagave spikes all interconnected in bundles that the typical landscaper's bag would hardly accomodate Any Wheelbarrow has the tandem balance not to

I watered the flowers in my granddaughters' courtyard.
That's great, How did you manage to carry the watering can? 
They are only small flower beds, so I could lift and pour quickly and easily.
How do you usually handle your laundry and grocery shopping?
I use a trolley to carry my items from the store to my decision. And I assign a caregiver or family member now to handle my washing.
Do you have your special ways when you water flowers in your own garden?
I installed a drip irrigation system using this rubber facata for cleaning. 
Is there an affordable
--------------------
What did you do today, Ms. Anderson?

I usually try to walk for at least 20 minutes in the neighborhood even if it hurts sometimes.
That's impressive. Do you take breaks during your walk or walk steadily through its duration?
I try to walk steadily as continuous sparing walks are theoretically and practically promising and will positively vent my mood.
That's good to hear. Do you find walking helpful in getting things done during the day or does it cause pain that is immobilising and prevents independence
--------------------
How was your day yesterday, did you do anything interesting?
Well, I did some lifting in the morning. I had to carry couple bags of plants to the garden.

Yes, I had to take the bus to a doctor's appointment this morning.
That's great to hear. Did you have a specific time for the appointment?
Yes, it was at 10 am. So, I had to take the bus quite early this morning.
Oh I see. Can you tell me more about that experience taking the bus?
It was alright. I had to walk to the nearest bus stop and wait for about 10 minutes until the bus arrived. It was somewhat crowded, but since I had a designated seat, it was manageable sitting down for most of the ride.
That's reassuring. How long was the trip

Do you usually take the bus to grocery shop?
These days, I've been taking the subway more often. My house is quite close to the station.
How about going to doctor appointments? How do you get there?
My daughter drives me there once a month for the regular check up.
That's helpful. How else do you get around town for other errands like going to the bank or post office?
To be honest, I prefer to walk when the weather is good. If not, I'll catch a cab to shorten the time.
Speaking of being outside, when was the last time you had a day trip or visited somebody out of town, and how did you get
--------------------
Hi, how are you feeling today?
I'm doing okay - feeling a little tired.
Aww, sorry to hear that. Did you do anything exciting or different today?
I took a taxi to the park to do a little bit of walking in the sun.
That sounds lovely. You mentioned taking a taxi - when did you go?
Around mid-morning, I think. Gives me some time to settle down after breakfast,
Makes sense. And which taxi company did you use?
Which one was it, now...oh I remember - it was called Shannon Cab.
Great. And did you use any mobility aids - a cane or other equipment - on your
--------------------
Do you often run errands outside your house, sir? 
Yes, I do. Usually every other day I have to go to the nearby ice-cream parlor where I volunteer. 
How do you usually go there? 
I go there by walking or sometimes driving my scooter named Jenny. 
Biking perhaps can give you more time an uncongested riding season six seasons out of every yearly horizon. Have you ever tried going on a bike to your volunteer activity? 
I actually haven't. I'm kinda fine spiking so far to get from to point B from Steadygo grandpas apartments, which hail up on six spectacular floors despite bits of my injellas acting

Hi there, I hope you're doing well today. Can I ask you something?
Of course, dear. What would you like to ask me abouut?
I'd like to know more about how mobility discomforts impact your life, could you elaborate a bit on that for me?
Oh boy, where do I start. About a month ago, I hurt my back quite badly and going back to my normal levels of groove is finally smoothing out gradually. 
I see. Does difficulty get in any particular time of the day?
usually morning, the pain generally is something I curse at few times to conclude how my next move if I've made the better call continuing till

I am delighted. Thank you. How about you?
I am fine too, Mrs. Jenkins. Can I help you with anything today?
Well. I have been feeling quite exhausted this recent week.
I am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me please when does feeling loss your energy namely breakthrough? 
After walking the hallway it Quite u strenuous to reach the stairs in time on these old legs.
That sounds frustrating, Mrs. Jenkins. How long have you experienced difficulty reaching the stairs on time?
At least six months from prior diminished compatibility breaking routine as to onset elapsed painful variables.
--------------------
Hi there! How's your day going?
Not bad, thank you. I've been keeping quite busy! How about yourself?
Yeah I'm good, thanks. Have you planned anything outdoors today?
Actually, I did manage to make a short trip to the park earlier this afternoon.
That's great! How did you manage to get there?
I decided to take a taxi. It always offers me convenience, since I can just sit and relax, while letting the driver navigate the streets.
I see. Is taking taxis a common way for you to get around these days?
Not really, but it really helps when i just want
--------------------
How did you get here today?
I took the bus this morning.
And what about yesterday? Did you go anywhere?
Yes, I went to the grocery store in the morning, and later in the day I drove to a doctor’s appointment down the street.
How often do you take the bus or drive yourself?
It really depends on the day, sometimes I take the bus, but sometimes I would drive to places nearby if I feel confident.
That’s good to know. Do you experience any difficulty with carrying objects while you go out?
Well, sometimes when carrying heavier bags from the groceries I do feel a bit tired frequent stops drain me so when possible make use of
--------------------
Have you been going out more frequently lately?
No, not really. I've been having more trouble with moving around.
Oh no, can you tell me more about that?
For example, every time I need to go to the grocery store, I need to take a taxi as home delivery takes too long.
I see. How about going to your regular doctor's appointments?
The bus stop is too far away from my house. Advancing for a taxi service on a punctilla basis every month would surely leave me out of budget. Sometimes my neighbor takes to me neighbor's car to see him which I really thanks
for doing it.
That's difficult. How do you usually
--------------------
Can you tell me about how you get around throughout the day?
Sure, I mostly use a walker to get around my house.
And outside of the house?
When I need to go shopping or run an errand, my daughter takes me.
Have you used public transportation before?
Only when my daughter isn't able, but it's been a while.
Which type of transportation did you use, the bus or subway?
Usually the bus, but it was difficult for me to get on and off.
Have you considered trying one of the smaller buses that cater specifically to those with mobility issues?
That's a good idea! Maybe I'll look into that
--------------------
How was your day today?
Oh, it was fine, not too bad. 
What things did you do today?
I mostly just stayed home, but I did go out to pick up some groceries. 
How did you go to the grocery store?
My grandson came over and drove me there in his car. 
That's good to hear. Do you go out often? 
Not really, my staying home is shucking corn and such. 
But do you have the ability to ride bicycles?
No, It has been a while after my sone removed security - taking pedals off routinely returned them leads toworrying words but learn
--------------------
How was your day today?
Oh, quite tiring actually. I had to go to the hospital for check-up this morning and go to the grocery store this afternoon.
How did you get to the hospital?
My son drove me there.
And to the grocery store?
I took my walking frame to the local offer thrift  store and back,
Is it difficult to move around with your walking frame?
Well, it can be. But I've been using it for a while now, so I'm used to it.
Do you take any other means of transport besides your walking stride? 
Sometimes. For longer distances, their on

Hi there, how are you doing today?
I'm doing okay. Had a busy week so far, seems like things never slow down anymore!
I can understand that, with everything you have going on lately. But I'm just wondering, how have you been getting around these days?
Well, I'm still able to drive every once in a while, but I've noticed it's becoming more difficult to manage on my own lately. And sometimes when I need to get somewhere but I'm unable to drive, I'll have to take a bus or a taxi.
Those options are always available, that's great! Could you tell me where do you usually go when you ride the bus or take a

How was your day today?
Not bad. Still got some grocery shopping done. 
Did you reschedule for the doctor's appointments?
I did. Managed to catch a Cab around 10AM yesterday. Was on time otherwise I'd miss my appointment.

Does that mean taking public transport too hard for you? What about trains or subways?

--------------------
What did you do yesterday?
I went to the grocery store.
How did you get there?
I walked there.
Was it difficult to walk there?
Yes, it was a bit of a challenge because it's a few blocks away and the sidewalks aren't even.
Have you considered driving next time?
I don't have a car anymore and I'm no longer able to drive.
Have you thought about taking the bus instead?
I haven't tried that, but I'm not sure which one goes to the grocery store.
I can look it up for you and show you which bus to take next time.
Oh, that would be
--------------------
How has your week been going?
It's been alright, just dealing with some mobility issues.
Would you mind telling me more about that?
Sure, some days I find it really difficult to get in and out of the car.
When does this usually happen?
Mostly after days where I've exerted myself physically, like doing gardening or going for a long walk.
Have you ever thought about getting a higher car or lowering yourself into the seat using a slide board or a handrail?
Yes, those are both options I've considered. I've also used a mobility standing pad and it has been really helpful too.
Do you have any similar issues with accessing public
