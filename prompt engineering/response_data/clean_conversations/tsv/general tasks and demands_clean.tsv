It was all right, but a bit exhaustng.
What did you do today that tired you out?
I was a little bit occupied and manic all day long running from task to task throughout the house without long rests.
What made you want to switch swiftly among several activities?
Even if activities' levels of complication varied a lot – dusting some ceramics and glass display which sorted up carrying comparatively sterile itzes up and down; creating environmentally secure mounting for the suet bag bunch obstruct my final single-task devoted nerves.But switching rew itself along throughout work day became necessary to complete household backup before the guests pop.

My son set it up for me last week. It helps me manage my pills and tracks when I've taken them, but I've been struggling to get the alerts set up just the way I need them.
That's a useful tool, for sure. Do you

More and more these past few weeks. Sometimes I even forget simple things like where I placed my wallet.

Not too much, but there's this constant fear in the back of my mind knowing that my health is not in the best shape.

Once I'm up, I manage to cook breakfast, turn on the morning news and get through some usual tasks around the house, but I've noticed I'm not as fast as I used to be. By the time I'm done, I can only manage for like an hour before feeling more appetite.
