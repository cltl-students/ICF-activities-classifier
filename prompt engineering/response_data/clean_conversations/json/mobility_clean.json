But mostly, it's a comfortable way to go around town.\nF: Do you",
        "F: Have you been out and about lately? \nP: Oh no, I rarely get the chance to go outside anymore. \nF: Why is that? \nP: I just find it difficult these days. I lost some strength in my legs, so walking outside isn’t easy. \nF: That must be difficult for you.

Do you ever take other forms of transportation like cabs or trains? \nP: Not really, unless my daughter drives us somewhere on the weekends. \nF: That makes sense. What activities can you still participate in that requires some mobility skill? \nP: A few occasions, I ride my stationary bike as soon as I woke up and before I sleep. Cycling beat other gym equipment, it appears motions",
        "F: How have you been, Mary? What have you been doing?\nP: Hello Emily, nice seeing you today. I have been busy doing some light exercise.\nF: That sounds great. What activities do you enjoy doing? \nP: Sometimes I like playing around with my cats, they love it fun.\nF: Also it seems like you're in good health at that age.But airmessages@gmail conceous people who are lose mobility inevitably cannot aviod a little activity over an event.you rmtoo look good shape physicinctually.

        "F: Hey, how was your weekend?\nP: It was okay. Not as eventful as usual, though.\nF: Oh, really? What did you end up doing? \nP: Just grocery shopping, trying so hard to get my act together nowadays.\nF: That sounds like a good idea. What did you come up with afterwards? \nP: I took a cab to the pharmacy to fill up on my medication. It was a scenery rush working our way through unpaved, pouring roads while engaging gentle flights of local talk.\nF: Was the cab easy to hail at that time? How did you go about it? \nP: Ordinary, made a simple package deal to get a cab quickly. Busks are quite post",

Moving around has just become especially challenging because of my recent knee surgery. But I try not to go out so that there aren't shocks putting too much impact on it right now. \nF: Makes sense. How about outpatient appointments in the clinic or visits to relatives - how're those",

It was somewhat crowded, but since I had a designated seat, it was manageable sitting down for most of the ride.\nF: That's reassuring. How long was the trip",
        "F: Do you usually take the bus to grocery shop?\nP: These days, I've been taking the subway more often. My house is quite close to the station.\nF: How about going to doctor appointments? How do you get there?\nP: My daughter drives me there once a month for the regular check up.\nF: That's helpful. How else do you get around town for other errands like going to the bank or post office?\nP: To be honest, I prefer to walk when the weather is good.

Usually every other day I have to go to the nearby ice-cream parlor where I volunteer. \nF: How do you usually go there? \nP: I go there by walking or sometimes driving my scooter named Jenny. \nF: Biking perhaps can give you more time an uncongested riding season six seasons out of every yearly horizon.
