10	I like having my daily walk on the street.

18	--------------------
19	Do you have any exciting plans for the weekend?
20	Not really, I usually just stay home and watch some TV.
21	That sounds nice. How about last weekend? Did you have any plans?
22	Yes, my grandson took me to see a movie.
23	Oh, what did you see?
24	We watched a comedy. I enjoyed it a lot.
25	That's great. Did you take the bus or a taxi?
26	My grandson drove me there in his car.
27	How about shopping? Do you go out to buy groceries or other necessities?
28	Yes, I usually go to the supermarket on Tuesdays.
29	That's awesome. Do you walk to the supermarket or take
30	--------------------
31	So, how has your day been, have you been doing a lot of moving or traveling around today? 
32	Well, yes, actually. Today I visited my friend who lives on the other side of the city with a taxi.
33	Oh, okay. How was your experience of the taxi ride? Is it accessible for a person that has problems with adopting to uneven surface?
34	I felt some bumps because of my tremulous legs and shaking muscles but regrettably the taxi can not make any extras for making it more navigable 
35	Was there much traffic on the road during that time? 
36	Yeah, there were a lot of cars and buses running on busy urban roads with their upper limits full-g
37	--------------------
38	Do you have a usual routine before going out in the morning?
39	Yes, I usually wake up around the same time and try to move around the house to warm up my body before heading out for local mobility events.
40	And how about going to visit your grandkids who live two hours away form you. When do you take that longer , out of your area trip?
41	I do this a few times per year. But taking care of accommodating my strength criteria beforehand make me feel apprehensive.
42	How far in advance do you need to make preparations for it?
43	I typically notify them a couple weeks ahead and will check medications and rentals needed .
44	--------------------
45	How was your morning today, and did you go out at all?
46	Yes dear, I went out for some shopping on my scooter. 
47	That sounds great. So when did you go shopping - in the morning? 
48	Not really dear, actually, I came back half an hour before you contacted.
49	Okay, got it. And how did your scooter function today?
50	The scooter is running still now without giving any hiccups, which is not bad at this age. But its battery depletes over time quite easily, so I charged before waking up today to avoid any breakdown and preserve its useful life. By the time I came home again in an hour, its driving capacity reduced sufficiently
51	--------------------
52	How has your day been today?
53	Not bad. Though every day is a bit challenging as it is difficult to move around nowadays.
54	What do you mean by that? Do you need Medical assistance frequently?
55	No, it is not medical help, but just my own mobility. I finding it difficult when taking buses or trains as I need to rely on knieksie. 
56	Do you use shopping home busses for getting the grocery towards casa?
57	Yes, one fairly arrives Monday evening. However one needs placing an order Saturday or before for them to know.
58	It appears Monday the recommendation would be Better What else do you do for mobility events? 
59	Sometimes, using a highway
60	--------------------
61	How are you feeling today?
62	I'm all right. Just a little tired.
63	Did you visit the supermarket today?
64	No, I walked to the hospital today to have my session.
65	How long do the sessions last?
66	Usually around an hour. Then I walk back home.
67	How are you finding the walk?
68	It can be tiring but I prefer it to taking the crowded tram.
69	Do you take the tram often?
70	Yes, at least two or three times during the week.
71	How busy is the tram usually?
72	Sometimes it can be crammed. But mostly, it's a comfortable way to go around town.
73	Do you
74	--------------------
75	Have you been out and about lately? 
76	Oh no, I rarely get the chance to go outside anymore. 
77	Why is that? 
78	I just find it difficult these days. I lost some strength in my legs, so walking outside isnâ€™t easy. 
79	That must be difficult for you. How do you usually get around? 
80	Generally, I use my scooter to get to my doctors or home services checks. 
81	And what about grocery shopping? That's also an essential activitiy, n'aest-par? 
82	Yes, I agree. On occasions my daughter helps pick up some groceries. Other times, there's this rare flyer called Maggie remarkable
83	--------------------
84	Hi there, how have you been?
85	I've been okay, thank you. 
86	I was just wondering, how have been getting around lately? 
87	Well, I usually walk to the grocery store every Tuesday and take the bus to the library on Wednesdays. 
88	That's great! Do you ever take other forms of transportation like cabs or trains? 
89	Not really, unless my daughter drives us somewhere on the weekends. 
90	That makes sense. What activities can you still participate in that requires some mobility skill? 
91	A few occasions, I ride my stationary bike as soon as I woke up and before I sleep. Cycling beat other gym equipment, it appears motions
92	--------------------
93	How have you been, Mary? What have you been doing?
94	Hello Emily, nice seeing you today. I have been busy doing some light exercise.
95	That sounds great. What activities do you enjoy doing? 
96	Sometimes I like playing around with my cats, they love it fun.
97	Also it seems like you're in good health at that age.But airmessages@gmail conceous people who are lose mobility inevitably cannot aviod a little activity over an event.you rmtoo look good shape physicinctually. Do you face any struggles with travel in someway, wantsome earlier concepts shared each doesn't mean putting it only within season in far ranges - activities change every wet season
98	--------------------
99	Hey, how was your weekend?
100	It was okay. Not as eventful as usual, though.
101	Oh, really? What did you end up doing? 
102	Just grocery shopping, trying so hard to get my act together nowadays.
103	That sounds like a good idea. What did you come up with afterwards? 
104	I took a cab to the pharmacy to fill up on my medication. It was a scenery rush working our way through unpaved, pouring roads while engaging gentle flights of local talk.
105	Was the cab easy to hail at that time? How did you go about it? 
106	Ordinary, made a simple package deal to get a cab quickly. Busks are quite post
107	--------------------
108	How was your day yesterday? 
109	Not too bad. I went for a short walk around the block which gave me a chance to get outside.
110	That sounds nice. How do you usually get around to run errands, like grocery shopping?
111	Mostly by car. My daughter takes me once a week.
112	Okay, and how about visiting friends or family?
113	I don't get around to see people as much anymore, but again, usually in the car when I do.
114	Makes sense. What about unexpected events like when going to a nature park or on vacation? How have you handled transportation for those occasions?
115	It's been a while since any of those happened for me. But
116	--------------------
117	Do you have any important appointments in the next couple of days?
118	Yes, I do. 
119	That's great! How do you usually make your way there- on the bus or maybe by car? 
120	Actually, my son would come and walk with alongside me. 
121	That's nice! Is there anything new that your doctors told you that especially caused disrupting mobility for you? 
122	Not really. Moving around has just become especially challenging because of my recent knee surgery. But I try not to go out so that there aren't shocks putting too much impact on it right now. 
123	Makes sense. How about outpatient appointments in the clinic or visits to relatives - how're those
124	--------------------
125	Have you been up to much today?
126	Yes, I had to take the bus to a doctor's appointment this morning.
127	That's great to hear. Did you have a specific time for the appointment?
128	Yes, it was at 10 am. So, I had to take the bus quite early this morning.
129	Oh I see. Can you tell me more about that experience taking the bus?
130	It was alright. I had to walk to the nearest bus stop and wait for about 10 minutes until the bus arrived. It was somewhat crowded, but since I had a designated seat, it was manageable sitting down for most of the ride.
131	That's reassuring. How long was the trip
132	--------------------
133	Do you usually take the bus to grocery shop?
134	These days, I've been taking the subway more often. My house is quite close to the station.
135	How about going to doctor appointments? How do you get there?
136	My daughter drives me there once a month for the regular check up.
137	That's helpful. How else do you get around town for other errands like going to the bank or post office?
138	To be honest, I prefer to walk when the weather is good. If not, I'll catch a cab to shorten the time.
139	Speaking of being outside, when was the last time you had a day trip or visited somebody out of town, and how did you get
140	--------------------
141	Hi, how are you feeling today?
142	I'm doing okay - feeling a little tired.
143	Aww, sorry to hear that. Did you do anything exciting or different today?
144	I took a taxi to the park to do a little bit of walking in the sun.
145	That sounds lovely. You mentioned taking a taxi - when did you go?
146	Around mid-morning, I think. Gives me some time to settle down after breakfast,
147	Makes sense. And which taxi company did you use?
148	Which one was it, now...oh I remember - it was called Shannon Cab.
149	Great. And did you use any mobility aids - a cane or other equipment - on your
150	--------------------
151	Do you often run errands outside your house, sir? 
152	Yes, I do. Usually every other day I have to go to the nearby ice-cream parlor where I volunteer. 
153	How do you usually go there? 
154	I go there by walking or sometimes driving my scooter named Jenny. 
155	Biking perhaps can give you more time an uncongested riding season six seasons out of every yearly horizon. Have you ever tried going on a bike to your volunteer activity? 
156	I actually haven't. I'm kinda fine spiking so far to get from to point B from Steadygo grandpas apartments, which hail up on six spectacular floors despite bits of my injellas acting
157	--------------------
158	Hi there, I hope you're doing well today. Can I ask you something?
159	Of course, dear. What would you like to ask me abouut?
160	I'd like to know more about how mobility discomforts impact your life, could you elaborate a bit on that for me?
161	Oh boy, where do I start. About a month ago, I hurt my back quite badly and going back to my normal levels of groove is finally smoothing out gradually. 
162	I see. Does difficulty get in any particular time of the day?
163	usually morning, the pain generally is something I curse at few times to conclude how my next move if I've made the better call continuing till
164	--------------------
165	Good morning! How are you feeling today, Mrs. Jenkins?
166	I am delighted. Thank you. How about you?
167	I am fine too, Mrs. Jenkins. Can I help you with anything today?
168	Well. I have been feeling quite exhausted this recent week.
169	I am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me please when does feeling loss your energy namely breakthrough? 
170	After walking the hallway it Quite u strenuous to reach the stairs in time on these old legs.
171	That sounds frustrating, Mrs. Jenkins. How long have you experienced difficulty reaching the stairs on time?
172	At least six months from prior diminished compatibility breaking routine as to onset elapsed painful variables.
173	--------------------
174	Hi there! How's your day going?
175	Not bad, thank you. I've been keeping quite busy! How about yourself?
176	Yeah I'm good, thanks. Have you planned anything outdoors today?
177	Actually, I did manage to make a short trip to the park earlier this afternoon.
178	That's great! How did you manage to get there?
179	I decided to take a taxi. It always offers me convenience, since I can just sit and relax, while letting the driver navigate the streets.
180	I see. Is taking taxis a common way for you to get around these days?
181	Not really, but it really helps when i just want
182	--------------------
183	How did you get here today?
184	I took the bus this morning.
185	And what about yesterday? Did you go anywhere?
186	Yes, I went to the grocery store in the morning, and later in the day I drove to a doctorâ€™s appointment down the street.
187	How often do you take the bus or drive yourself?
188	It really depends on the day, sometimes I take the bus, but sometimes I would drive to places nearby if I feel confident.
189	Thatâ€™s good to know. Do you experience any difficulty with carrying objects while you go out?
190	Well, sometimes when carrying heavier bags from the groceries I do feel a bit tired frequent stops drain me so when possible make use of
191	--------------------
192	Have you been going out more frequently lately?
193	No, not really. I've been having more trouble with moving around.
194	Oh no, can you tell me more about that?
195	For example, every time I need to go to the grocery store, I need to take a taxi as home delivery takes too long.
196	I see. How about going to your regular doctor's appointments?
197	The bus stop is too far away from my house. Advancing for a taxi service on a punctilla basis every month would surely leave me out of budget. Sometimes my neighbor takes to me neighbor's car to see him which I really thanks
198	for doing it.
199	That's difficult. How do you usually
200	--------------------
201	Can you tell me about how you get around throughout the day?
202	Sure, I mostly use a walker to get around my house.
203	And outside of the house?
204	When I need to go shopping or run an errand, my daughter takes me.
205	Have you used public transportation before?
206	Only when my daughter isn't able, but it's been a while.
207	Which type of transportation did you use, the bus or subway?
208	Usually the bus, but it was difficult for me to get on and off.
209	Have you considered trying one of the smaller buses that cater specifically to those with mobility issues?
210	That's a good idea! Maybe I'll look into that
211	--------------------
212	How was your day today?
213	Oh, it was fine, not too bad. 
214	What things did you do today?
215	I mostly just stayed home, but I did go out to pick up some groceries. 
216	How did you go to the grocery store?
217	My grandson came over and drove me there in his car. 
218	That's good to hear. Do you go out often? 
219	Not really, my staying home is shucking corn and such. 
220	But do you have the ability to ride bicycles?
221	No, It has been a while after my sone removed security - taking pedals off routinely returned them leads toworrying words but learn
222	--------------------
223	How was your day today?
224	Oh, quite tiring actually. I had to go to the hospital for check-up this morning and go to the grocery store this afternoon.
225	How did you get to the hospital?
226	My son drove me there.
227	And to the grocery store?
228	I took my walking frame to the local offer thrift  store and back,
229	Is it difficult to move around with your walking frame?
230	Well, it can be. But I've been using it for a while now, so I'm used to it.
231	Do you take any other means of transport besides your walking stride? 
232	Sometimes. For longer distances, their on
233	--------------------
234	Hi there, how are you doing today?
235	I'm doing okay. Had a busy week so far, seems like things never slow down anymore!
236	I can understand that, with everything you have going on lately. But I'm just wondering, how have you been getting around these days?
237	Well, I'm still able to drive every once in a while, but I've noticed it's becoming more difficult to manage on my own lately. And sometimes when I need to get somewhere but I'm unable to drive, I'll have to take a bus or a taxi.
238	Those options are always available, that's great! Could you tell me where do you usually go when you ride the bus or take a
239	--------------------
240	How was your day today?
241	Not bad. Still got some grocery shopping done. 
242	Did you reschedule for the doctor's appointments?
243	I did. Managed to catch a Cab around 10AM yesterday. Was on time otherwise I'd miss my appointment.
244	That sounds convenient. Is it your preferred mode of transport?
245	Absolutely, hassle-free, that driver knew safest and advantageous routes. Retinograph test bears stressful for me not

247	Does that mean taking public transport too hard for you? What about trains or subways?
248	Retirement Pension facilitates without insurance scheme suffered broke buses hurled disport left of Station interiors.
249	--------------------
250	What did you do yesterday?
251	I went to the grocery store.
252	How did you get there?
253	I walked there.
254	Was it difficult to walk there?
255	Yes, it was a bit of a challenge because it's a few blocks away and the sidewalks aren't even.
256	Have you considered driving next time?
257	I don't have a car anymore and I'm no longer able to drive.
258	Have you thought about taking the bus instead?
259	I haven't tried that, but I'm not sure which one goes to the grocery store.
260	I can look it up for you and show you which bus to take next time.
261	Oh, that would be
262	--------------------
263	How has your week been going?
264	It's been alright, just dealing with some mobility issues.
265	Would you mind telling me more about that?
266	Sure, some days I find it really difficult to get in and out of the car.
267	When does this usually happen?
268	Mostly after days where I've exerted myself physically, like doing gardening or going for a long walk.
269	Have you ever thought about getting a higher car or lowering yourself into the seat using a slide board or a handrail?
270	Yes, those are both options I've considered. I've also used a mobility standing pad and it has been really helpful too.
271	Do you have any similar issues with accessing public
