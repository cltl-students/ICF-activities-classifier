22	Yes, getting dressed is my responsibility but sometimes I get worried about lifting my arms to put on clothes.
23	That makes sense. And do you bathe yourself in the morning?
24	Yes, but recently, I've needed help getting in and out of the tub because I'm worried about falling. 
25	Hmm, maybe you could use a bath chair or shower seat to reduce the risk of falling if you're worried about that?
26	Good idea. I'll discuss it with my caregiver.

39	Well, I couldn't put them on by myself these days as my flexibility declined lately.
40	I see. What kind of clothings cause difficulty? 
41	Putting my pants on alone has become challenging, especially those that close over my abdomen because they require remaining upright for extended periods while doing two nonlinear motions altogether as tightly.

47	That sounds great. How do you manage to dress yourself each day?
48	It takes me a little longer, but I usually put my clothes on over my amputated leg and then figure out how to hybrid into my wheelchair and standing rather than sitting thereafter.

63	How do you feel about getting dressed in the morning? Is it an easy task?
64	Oh, putting on my clothes is much easier than taking them off.
65	Why is that?
66	Well, to put it bluntly, I have trouble with my shoulders. I can get my shirt and pants on without much fuss but taking them off can be quite a struggle.

112	Did you cut the toast and put butter on it yourself? 
113	Yes, I did everything by myself, I use a butter knife to put butter on the toas.

117	It was alright, thanks. 
118	That's nice. Have you had breakfast this morning? 
119	Yes, every morning I do. 
120	What's your usual breakfast? Is there something you couldn't prepare? 
121	Today, I had oatmeal, which is something I can prepare for myself if the oats are already prepared, that is. If not, sometimes that turns into a hassle. 
122	Do you ever have trouble cutting or moulding your food on your own? Say... with forks or knives? 
123	It definitely help when half a meal is already preparation: cut down apples rather that ordinary pips!
124	--------------------
125	Hey there, how was your day today?
126	It was okay, not much to mention. I had difficulties with lunchtime.
127	Lunch? what happened?
128	All I had was soup and it was too hot to eat properly.
129	Did you make it yourself or did somebody offer it poorly heated?
130	I had some leftovers from last night. I microwave it longer than usual. 
131	--------------------
132	I noticed how well-dressed you are today! Did you get dressed by yourself this morning?
133	Indeed, I did. With little bit effort alongside some repositions may how hard walking moving can do me. I ware long- sleeve closed pajama tops with black paints.
134	That's great! Was there any difficulty in choosing clothes and buttons?
135	No issue. Round collar held prominent rather stood beside when making sure the top naturally removable coordinated through hood provision and using right starting queue in assembly sequence forth.

142	Good, good. I've been meaning to check up on you-- how have your daily life events been?
143	Well, not so easy to manage if I'm honest, but I have someone to help out here and it solves half of it. What'd you mean exactly?
144	I wondered whether preparing something really limited your capabilities, such as cutting a rather difficult food for a packed lunch or doing meal started to demands superhuman strength.
145	Yes, there are times when food is not found easily pre-chopped , you won’t see eye-to
146	--------------------
147	How was your day, did you do anything fun today?
148	Not really, just some shopping as usual from the local grocery store and then returned home. 
149	Sounds like a routine, it's important to take care of you as well! Are you able to dress yourself in different clothes or do you stick to comfortable ones only? 
150	Well, mostly I wear gowns or outfits having large buttons due to grip issues with little experience in pairing up clothing items. 
151	That makes sense. Also, do you able to prepare your standard meals themselves sufficient in terms of health?
152	Yeah, I try my best to ensure sound balance while at having my schedule planned which nowadays focus more onto repetitive dishes come breakfast
153	--------------------
154	Hi there, how have you been?
155	I have been okay. Just struggling with some of my daily routine activities.
156	That sounds tough. Can you give me an example?
157	Sure, well, I struggle with eating meals by myself.
158	Oh, when and how does that occur?
159	Mostly at dinner when I am alone, some stuff can be difficult to cut and I tend to spill quite a bit of food while I eat.
160	That can be quite frustrating. Have you tried using smaller cutlery and plates previously?
161	Yeah, I have tried but they seem too awkwardsmall to hold. I am thinking about starting fingerling eating.
162	Have you consulted with your care
163	--------------------

167	Well I typically take breakfast before eleven o'clock by pouring cereals neatly into a bowl beforehand with some chopped fruits of preferable suit beside trying not to fill myself too much.

FISH SANDWICHES,milk down and with mass meetings

173	When is it typically hard for you to eat?
174	I seem to struggle most with dinner. 
175	Hmm, does cuttingusing utensils cause any difficulty?
176	On occasion. But since I started using an adaptive utensil set, that helps.
177	Right, that's great. When do typically take your meals at night time?
178	Usually around 6 PM as per my patterns.
179	That makes sense. What typically gets easier about the nightly
180	--------------------
181	Are you enjoying your meal, Mrs. Johnson?
182	Indeed, but it's getting harder to finish my meal these days. 
183	Is it because of any pain?
184	No. Maybe in my younger days, I had no problem with cutting food into smaller pieces. now with my hands slightly more firm and shaky, it's starting to become a weakness of mine.

215	Things have generally been good but activities can be challenging these days.
216	What kinds of things have you found difficult? 
217	You know, everyday self-care activities like eating with utensils has proven hard for me. 
218	Why is that way? 
219	Though I can usually manage scoff correctly, It's uneasy for me to manipulate with knife, forks and spoons around one hand. particularly when preparing individual parts of the dish.
220	Oh i see. 
221	 Those types of situations when one carelessly ends up an undersized and unstable creaside while mingling food pieces definitely only augments and leads towards disorder sine one small part will

233	Well, it was just an ordinary day. Nothing special to point out.
234	Actually, I really wanna know about your ability to do daily tasks. You have admirable resilience, living alone and away from your family.
235	I try my best to complete my daily tasks without sacrificing on safety and hygiene. 
236	That 's amazing! Which daily task do you feel comfortable with when living alone?
237	Having meals usually counters s difficult task so I do home deliveries. Chopping vegetables and cutting foods into small pieces that require fine motor, e.g just cutting apple makes me feel tired. Spreading butter using table knives worksed

254	Oh, that's great. Do you have any difficulties in pouring the milk?
255	No, the 4-ounce container size is ideal for me.

265	Well, pouring liquids is not the easiest task these days.
266	Really? How come?
267	My hands shake a bit sometimes and it's hard to stabilize the pitcher or cup.
268	Ah, I see. How do manage to accomplish that task?
269	Usually I ask for help or try bracing myself against like a surface.

274	I'm feeling okay today.
275	That's nice. So do you often drink water throughout the day?
276	Yes, I try to drink a full glass of water with each meal.
277	That's great. And how do you usually refill your water cup?
278	Usually, I scoop the ice into the glass and refill it once I finish the previous glass.

292	What do you mean by taking care of myself?
293	For instance, do you find it easy to pour liquids into cups and drink water?
294	I’ve been having some trouble with that actually. It strains my hands to have to hold glasses too.
295	And how about dressing yourself?
296	That becomes painful as well, particularly transferring weight in order to put a shirt on
297	And what do you do for drinking liquids now to make it less painful?
298	I usually wait until someone is around to pour drinks out of larger bottles into cups so it can be bit easier for me to drink
