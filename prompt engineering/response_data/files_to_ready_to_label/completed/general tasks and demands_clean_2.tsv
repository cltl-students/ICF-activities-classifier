69	I can imagine...do you have a specific routine for chores?

71	Sounds very practical!

74	It's the usual routine for me. Woke up in the morning, took a quick shower, and made breakfast.
75	Are there appointments scheduled for you today?
76	Not really, just a doctor's visit in the afternoon.
77	How about other household tasks?
78	I need to do laundry, water the plants, and clean the bathroom later. These tasks usually take me one to two hours.
79	That sounds productive. How often do you do these household tasks?
80	I always plan them on the weekends and complete them within the day.

101	Yeah, I unruffled my stress quickly and without issues?
102	That's great to hear! How about other interactions you have during the day? Are you able
103	--------------------
104	Did you have any errands to run today?
105	Actually, I did. My granddaughter helped me make a grocery list and we went shopping in the morning.
106	That's wonderful! How did you feel during the shopping trip?
107	Well, I get tired more easily nowadays. Fortunately, my granddaughter mainly pushed the cart and she commended me on being able to retrieve most things without any issue. 
108	I see. Sounds like you handled that situation smoothly. Are there any other typical tasks you need to do regularly?
109	Overall, I like cooking. but I must admit sometimes face the effort too wearisome. Still, regularly, I prepare two significant dishes, diverse courses, alongside a  side.
110	--------------------
111	How was your day, did you do something interesting lately?
112	Well, not really. Mostly wake up in the morning, sit down and read routine newspaper.
113	I see. Do you engage in some exercise after it or is there no physical activity involved?
114	After the breakfast, I like taking a walk in the park nearby. Though it's not exactly a walking meditation!
115	That's great. How long is your walk usually?
116	It's usually one mile if the weather permits. But I skipped it on some hot afternoons.
117	That's understandable. And do you do anything else?

138	--------------------
139	How was your day today, Ms. James?
140	It was okay but I struggled a bit with the new pill regime Mr. Hopkins gave me. 
141	Could you tell me more about that? 
142	He asked me to take them after the meals. It gets tricky when there is a buffet or when you order anything from outdoor, sandwiches and hamburgers come fast. 
143	That sounds hard. Do you have any solution to it? 
144	Trying to have controlled portions as much as possible. I now prefer to cook my own meals so my nutrition count is consistent. 
145	That was a good point. What about daily activities, any menial repetitive job is significantly tough for a reason? You

161	Right after breakfast. I usually bake some cookies or cake in the morning.
162	That's a great way to start the day. Do you clean right after baking, or at a different time?
163	I always need to clean up after baking, especially when using different equipments and ingredients. I clean all my plate right afterward.
164	I can imagine. Do you ever feel stressed with all these tasks to do?
165	I guess I do, especially when there are many people to feed in the evening. I try to spread the baking and cleaning across the
166	--------------------
167	How is your afternoon performance these days?
168	It depends on the day. Sometimes I have good days where I can finish all my little tasks around the house. 
169	And on the bad days?
170	On the difficult days, I usually need to take one long soak in the bath, then rest before doing anything. Twice as hard it feels running tests to review bills and tracking deductible movements.
171	I see. Do you notice feeling stressed during these some daily life activities?
172	It feels difficult in general to handle multiple tasks together. It is tough to juggle doing wash while indoor gardening and keeping small television conversations going, but on regular days, I realize what could be promptly required with ease. 
173	--------------------
174	How was your morning, did you go for a walk like you usually do?

179	Honestly, these visits have become tiring lately, they often require attention from different medical services than exercise and are occupying considering of coming home.
180	I understand, you always stick to quite traditionschedule. Do you have other events you do too?
181	From time to time my fair share, week holidays sun at march get

185	What kind of routines are you referring to? 
186	Just simple ones such as cooking meals and taking care of the house's moderate cleanliness.
187	Are you able to level tasks for things required along with physical task sweekly? 
188	Yes, but sometimes things can fall apart due to my aging body not permitting passage of the rigors it once did without much of adverse con-junct placed in disposal checklist to skirtted?
189	Are there certain tasks that are particularly difficult for you?
190	The more physically demanding ones thereforeoften tend to exhaust me well towards exhaustion
191	--------------------
192	How was your day today?
193	It was all right, but a bit exhaustng.
194	What did you do today that tired you out?
195	I was a little bit occupied and manic all day long running from task to task throughout the house without long rests.
196	What made you want to switch swiftly among several activities?
197	Even if activities' levels of complication varied a lot – dusting some ceramics and glass display which sorted up carrying comparatively sterile itzes up and down; creating environmentally secure mounting for the suet bag bunch obstruct my final single-task devoted nerves.But switching rew itself along throughout work day became necessary to complete household backup before the guests pop.

205	Sometimes it's overwhelming, but I try to prioritize what needs to be done. I make a list and work my way through it.
206	That's a good strategy! Do you often have days like this?
207	Not every day, but at my age, I have a lot of doctor's appointments and things I need
208	--------------------

238	Why is that? Do you have anything head up eg don’t items in the house?
239	Well, yes, I had a pile of clothes to fold early this morning.
240	Is folding your laundry normally a daily or weekly task for you?

254	Well, today I tried to organize a small part of my bookshelf, it didn't end well.
255	Why is that?
256	It's getting difficult for me to carry out this routine. I bruised myself by mistake.
257	That doesn't sound good. Did you get with something while trying to move something?
258	Yes, a stack of my books lost balance, and I couldn't hold it.
