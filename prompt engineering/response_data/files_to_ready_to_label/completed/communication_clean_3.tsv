161	What sort of things did it most relate to? Did you do something new? 
162	Not a new 'something' exactly noteworthy-but oddly trivial sort: lost my cheque card to today's grocery chip lock corner, and my wobbly steps held up mum and Bill in line ready-to-pay attention until I should rather wake my mind up quickly.. so I clumsily wandered through code putting Jane's expected text but really emitting, actually mixing apps.

260	--------------------
261	What did you do today?
262	Today, I went grocery shopping for myself.
263	That's great! How did you communicate with the cashier?
264	I had a lot of trouble hearing her, so I asked her to speak louder.
265	Ah, it sounds like interacting acoustically is problematic for you. Maybe we can check for communication devices later again?

283	For the most part. Sometimes I have to ask people to repeat themselves though.
284	I understand. Do you feel like your hearing has an impact on your ability to hold conversations over the phone?
