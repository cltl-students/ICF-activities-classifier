0	How was your day today?
1	It was an okay day. I went to the grocery store to get some food I needed.
2	That's good. Did you interact with anyone at the store?
3	Yes, I did encounter a woman in my aisle who needed help reaching for an item on the top shelf.
4	Did you offer to help her?
5	Yes, I did offer her and got her the item she was looking for.
6	That was nice of you. What about the checkout process, did you communicate with the cashier?
7	Yes, I did. The cashier greeted me and I said hi back. I thanked her at the end when I was done checking out.
8	It seems
9	--------------------
10	How have you been feeling today?
11	Oh, just so so. Nothing too eventful happened. 
12	Well, how've things been with your family lately? 
13	Good, I had a dinner party yesterday in order to cope with difficult personal transitions within three months. The gathering wasn’t quite easy anytime two out of three spreekable event-triggered let's call it ‘really passionate political announcer monologes of obliviant uncle, threatening younger soberleisure sections by forming his mindset-contemporary stance’. I had to put things my way. 
14	I can understand how that must have been stressful. Did the dinner party go smoothly besides that conflict?
15	Overall, it was quite synchronizing and
16	--------------------
17	How was your day, did anything memorable happen today?
18	Oh dear, you know how visitors day went yesterday?
19	No, I wasn't informed. What exactly happened?
20	My granddaughter fell asleep half-way through meditation and I scolded her a little loudly on front of everybody... well, that's what struck with me.
21	I see. Could you have reacted differently, looking back?
22	What can I say - my pride gets the better half of me. 
23	Since you recognize that pride is affecting your relationships event negatively in your interpersonal networks, how can we pin down specific process steps to change that issue?
24	I’m really looking
25	--------------------
26	Hey, how was your day today?
27	Oh, it was fine, just like any other day.
28	Really? What did you do today?
29	I took a walk in the garden and saw some people feeding the ducks. I wanted to go closer and watch them but I thought it might not be appropriate to impose on strangers.
30	Well, that’s very responsible of you to think that way. Maybe they wouldn’t mind or even be happy to let you watch.
31	Yes, maybe you’re right. I always try to be respectful and considerate of others.
32	That’s really commendable! But don’t ever lose your sense of wonder about the things around you too.
33	Oh,
34	--------------------
35	Hi, how are you today?
36	Good, thanks for asking. How about you?
37	I’m doing well. Can you tell me about something interesting or meaningful that happened to you recently? 
38	Well, my son came to visit me last weekend. We watched some movies together.
39	That sounds nice. Did you both enjoy it?
40	Yes, we did. It's always nice to have him around but It was a bit difficult to choose what Movie to watch as our preferences are different.
41	I can understand. Did that cause any problem between you two?
42	No, we talked through our preferences, their ratings, and found something that we both was something we hadn’t seen yet and
43	--------------------
44	So, how has your day been so far?
45	It's been okay I guess.
46	Is there anything specific on your mind?
47	Yeah actually. Yesterday, my daughter came to visit me at the retirement home.
48	Ah, that sounds lovely! How did it go?
49	I was happy to see her of course. But some of her comments really annoyed me.
50	What kind of comments?
51	Well... She kept asking about aspects of how I live here as if she thought I'm hopeless by being passive around here.
52	How she went detail or specific expectations?, Did she explain with calm or became angry unable to understand that actions still represent responsibility?
53	Actually mostly things
54	--------------------
55	Good morning! How has your day been so far, anything interesting to share?
56	Oh, not really. Just trying to keep up with my routine like usual, you know.
57	I know what you mean. But despite the regiments, there must come events now and then worth telling others about, right?
58	Like what, though?
59	Well, I believe for elderly patients like you sometimes things can pop up involuntary in the foreground while having familiar conversations. Maybe when trying to following someone’s storytelling or trying to lead others in trying your favoured board game behaviours, in the cafe occasionally trying talking daily running beforehand smoothly with a variable barkeeper. For me eventually hair rising stands accompanying unbelievable overnight successes hearing awesome phone conversations
60	--------------------
61	How was your day today?
62	Oh it was alright, I had a nice chat with a neighbor this afternoon.
63	That's great to hear. Can you tell me about the conversation?
64	Well, we spoke about our gardens and the vegetables we like to plant. It was interesting to learn about different gardening techniques she used.
65	it looks like she's a nature lover! You've been living in this neighbourhood for a while, right?
66	Yes, I have. I feel more comfortable building connections with the people in my immediate vicinity as I see them more frequently around.
67	I can understand that. How about yesterday? Did you see your grandchild?
68	Yes, they came over for a
69	--------------------
70	How was your day today?
71	Oh, it was okay.
72	Just okay? What did you do?
73	Well, I had a doctor's appointment this morning. Then I came home and watched some TV.
74	That sounds pretty routine. Anything happen during your appointment?
75	Not really, just a check-up. The doctor asked how I've been feeling since my last visit.
76	Did you tell them about anything that's been bothering you lately?
77	Actually, yes. I mentioned I feel like I've been more forgetful lately.
78	And what did the doctor say?
79	They did some tests and told me it's probably just a part of aging. I didn't really like
80	--------------------
81	How's your day going so far?
82	It hasn't been too bad, just had a bit of trouble with my neighbor this morning.
83	Trouble? What happened?
84	Well, I have been trying to talk to him about something bothering me for the past few days but he never seems to listen.
85	That sounds frustrating. Did anything happen today?
86	Yeah, he completely disregarded what I was saying and walked away mid-conversation.
87	I'm sorry to hear that. Have you thought of any other approach to talk to him about your concern?
88	Yes, I plan on writing him a letter, maybe that way he will take the time to really listen to what I have to say.
89	--------------------
90	How are you feeling today?
91	Oh, I am doing well. Just feeling a bit sluggish.
92	I see, anything interesting happen to you recently?
93	Yes, actually. I was trying to make phone calls earlier today but was having trouble hearing the person on the other line.
94	That does sound frustrating. Did it impact your phone call much?
95	Unfortunately, yes. It made interacting socially through the phone much harder and really weighed on me.
96	That makes sense. When did you start experiencing hearing issues in your phone calls?
97	It started a few weeks ago and has started progressively causing me more troubles since I am struggling in catching some of sentences from my kin eard. 
98	--------------------
99	How has your day been?
100	Not bad, but I'm having trouble keeping in touch with people lately.
101	Oh really? Did something happen that makes it hard to stay connected?
102	Well, I think I have a little trouble sometimes understanding when someone is just busy, or when they might be ignoring me.
103	That can definitely be tough. Do you ever check in with the person and ask if everything's okay?
104	Not typically. I feel like I don't want to bother them or push too much on something.
105	I can understand that, but sometimes it might be good to just communicate openly. That way, both parties can share their thoughts and feelings without any misunderstandings.
106	--------------------
107	So, how's your day going, feeling any better today?
108	Yes, a little bit. As I told you last time, Rosy came over to see me today.
109	Oh, that's great to hear. Did you both had a good chat?
110	Yes, at the beginning, she told me had a rough time with work and after some talking, she confided that she had lost her grandmother recently.
111	It is terrible news; Death of a couple ones can overwhelmingly deplete.
112	P : Yes, after her words, I just held on her as she sobbed for a while.
113	But some speech may put smile; Hopefully today's reminiscing would have improve satisfactory feat of arousal.
114	--------------------
115	Hi there, how have you been doing today?
116	Oh it's been alright I suppose. Had some visitors earlier.
117	That's nice to hear! Tell me a bit more about that.
118	Well I had family come visit me. It's always nice to see them, but unfortunately we had a little disagreement towards the end of their visit.
119	That's too bad. What caused the disagreement?
120	Oh it was just a small misunderstanding that got blown out of proportion. I think we just took what each other were saying the wrong way.
121	That happens sometimes. Have you talked to them since then?
122	Yes, actually. We sorted things out and came to an understanding. It turned out
123	--------------------
124	How was your day going?
125	It was fine. Something interesting happened, though.
126	What was it?
127	I went to the supermarket and the lady behind me in the checkout line was in a rush. She kept banging into me with the shopping cart and wasn't saying anythingappearingignoring me if I would have made a mistake that in the meantime annoyance gestures appeared in her attitudes due to bad manners still standing there even did my shopping so fast but what had gott more mind aboutthis Iseen scenes.
128	Oh wow, that's not very pleasant. How did you react to that situation?
129	I noticed that she had a lot of items that shegot faster-than –usual thus seen
130	--------------------
131	How was your day, did anything significant happen?
132	Funny you should ask - had some important chats with my neighbors while out getting some exercise today.
133	That's great, did you enjoy those interactions with your neighbors?
134	Absolutely! We talked mostly about our interests, they gave me some inspirational thoughts, made me happy.
135	Nice, how often do you typically interact with yous neihbor, have lived there forhtong looking?
136	They make an effort on weekends, recently moved there. Especially now I try to say hello every chance I get to feel some connection.
137	That's lovely.When you get novid,outnof your neighbourhood,how many if you interactons with lossliez ones
138	--------------------
139	Tell me more about your day-to-day interactions. 
140	Sometimes, I avoid interactions when I feel overwhelmed. 
141	When do these interactions make you feel overwhelmed? 
142	Crowded and noisy spaces, especially when people start veering too close.
143	That makes sense. What kind of interactions do you prefer?
144	Ones where we have enough personal space. Also, I'm more happy to discuss more sort of a being deep thought subject than over drinking blusters. 
145	Sounds reasonable. Can you share an example of your favorite discussion topic? 
146	Oh, I think I'm more careful on information flow nowadays. Politics, values, theory-relating underbehavior stuff—almost consuming now
147	--------------------
148	Not much to do these days?
149	Not really, been just staying home all the time.
150	That must be difficult for you. Are you keeping in touch with anyone in your family? 
151	I receive some calls from my son every week.
152	That's great, are you able to express your feelings with him? 
153	Yes, he is a good listener, empathetic too. 
154	Any shortcomings in terms of communicating with others around you? 
155	Sometimes, my neighbor creates loud noises after I stayed reminding him.
156	Oh! Are you able to avoid further escalating the situation? 
157	It took conscious efforts from my part to avoid increasing tension.
158	That seems difficult
159	--------------------
160	Hi, how are you doing today?
161	I'm doing alright, how about you?
162	I'm good too. So what have you been up to lately?
163	Oh, not much really. Just staying at home mostly.
164	Have you been in touch with any of your friends or family?
165	Well, my niece came to visit me the other day. We sat outside and had some tea together.
166	That sounds lovely. Do you often see your niece?
167	No, not really. She lives quite far away, so I only see her once or twice a year when she visits.
168	How did you feel about spending time with her the other day?
169	It was nice to
170	--------------------
171	How was your morning today, did anything interesting happen? 
172	Yes, a neighbor of mine came and helped me carry in the groceries. I just moved into the complex two weeks ago and she must have seen me going in and out by myself. 
173	That was really kind of your neighbor. So, did you exchange words or interact at all? 
174	Well yes, but only pleasantries. We barely know each other, I really can't guess why she choose to it. 
175	It was probably out of sincere thinking. It doesn't look easy to maneuver in during this heat-wave but yet she did it. Betray of respect and friendship stance from herself. 
176	--------------------
177	How has your day been going?
178	Oh, my day has been pretty uneventful actually. 
179	What have you done so far then? 
180	I went to the grocery store and met with some old friends afterward.
181	That sounds like a good circle of support to have. Do you usually regularly keep in touch with these friends? 
182	Not as much as we used to, but we catch up on occasions.
183	Do you ever have disagreements or the conversations does not flow sometimes when keeping up-to-working affiliinations or sound associations with warm people you know?
184	Yeah definitely. It sometimes is difficult now with age you know, you don't share
185	--------------------
186	Hi, how are you feeling today?
187	I am feeling alright, thanks for asking.
188	Can you tell me how the conversations go between you and the home aide?
189	It generally goes smoothly, but there was one day where a little misunderstanding caused a conflict.
190	What happened and how did you react to the situation on that day?
191	Well, the home aide had misread the healthcare advocate's note about my dislikes, and ordered warm tea instead of ice tea. When she brought it to me, I explained it's actually ice-tea I very don't like warm things particularly liquid, it stem back from . I realized she felt angry and panicket ignored anything further counsel fiximg the ordet
192	--------------------
193	Tell me about your day today.
194	Well, I went to the market to buy some items for my house.
195	That sounds like a regular activity. Did you interact with anyone while you were there?
196	Yes, actually I spoke with a few of the people there. 
197	Can you tell me more about that? How did you interact with them?
198	Well, I greeted the vendor who was already familiar with me. She asked how I was and commented on how she hadn't seen me in a while. We chatted briefly before I cam upon a mean looking individual. 
199	What happened there? 
200	The instant felt somber with this appearance but smiled and offered a friendly hello in
201	--------------------
202	Hi, how are you feeling today?
203	Oh, hi there. I'm okay, just a bit tired.
204	Yeah, I can imagine. Did anything in particular happen today?
205	Yes, earlier today I went shopping for groceries at the supermarket, and I almost got into a confrontation with another shopper.
206	Oh, that sounds upsetting, what happened?
207	Well, I was standing by the dairy products, trying to decide what kind of milk to buy, and a lady came up next to me and started reaching into the fridge over my shoulder.
208	That must have been uncomfortable.
209	Yes it was. I said excuse me politely and indicated that she was bothering me. But she
210	--------------------
211	Hi, how's everything going?
212	It's been pretty ok. I had an episode the other day at the grocery store though.
213	Can you tell me more about that?
214	Sure. I was reaching for a can of soup on the top shelf when a group of shoppers behind me started chatting pretty loudly. It startled me and made me lose my balance a bit. Before I knew it, the can slipped out of my hands and fell to the ground, making a pretty loud noise.
215	Oh, that must have been embarrassing. Did anyone help you?
216	Actually, one of the marshals walked over and offered to tone down the disposition so it doesn’t scare the others. So it all gone nicely
217	--------------------
218	How was your day today, how did you spend your day? 
219	My day was quite busy. I went to the market to purchase groceries and afterwards visited my friend.
220	What did you buy in the market today? 
221	Mostly vegetables and some fruits. I also picked some cereals for my meals for the next few days.
222	Great! How many people did you interact with when shopping?
223	I had to interact with few people, a shopkeeper and a fellow customer who happened to be there. 
224	During the shopping, what difficult challenges did you meet dealing with people interaction or social norms?
225	Oh, nothing much actually. Except encountered a some delays
226	--------------------
227	How are you today, can you tell me how your day has been so far? 
228	My day is doing much better; I just came from playing chess with my group. 
229	Oh! that's great! an excellent pastime game, so does weekend's visitors stimulate or uplift your type's participating more pro-actively mid-week meals with individual mates? any main contrasts that exemplify other food outcomes according to occasion distinction? 
230	Unfortunately I usually eat alone, yeah the visits from my family definitely keep me happy whenever they visit the weekend. 
231	That's understandable, having some companies definitely lighten up life at old age. I suppose mid-day meal scenes are less interesting without betwixt matches
232	--------------------
233	Hi there! How are you doing today?
234	Hello. I'm having an okay day I guess.
235	Is anything worrying you lately? Is anything holding you back?
236	I suppose I have this issue with inhibitions around others. I met some new friends at the communal room for coffee the other day unusually and tried to connect, ended up feeling out of place.Like I see others new which was fun. 
237	Hmm, that does sound like a difficult situation. When else have you experienced similar feelings in social situations?
238	Well, a few days ago, I went to the park and struggled to get into regular discussion with some members of baking class . Similar inhibition prevailing with touching other's Aprons
239	--------------------
240	So, how are you doing today?
241	I am okay, just enjoying my day.
242	That is great to hear. Anything interesting happen to you recently?
243	Well, last week my grandson stopped by to visit me.
244	That sounds nice. How did you feel about that?
245	I was really happy. I always love when I get to spend time with my grandson.
246	That's great! How did the interactions go with your grandson?
247	We had a great talk and he is always so attentive to me. 
248	When does he leave?
249	He left Sunday but he promised we will talk again this week.
250	I bet you really appreciated the time he took to meet
251	--------------------
252	How are you doing today, any exciting events happen this week?
253	Well, there was the day where I encountered some trouble getting around while shopping in the store.
254	Oh no, what happened?
255	One of the people before me in the aisle had a mobility cart overflowed with merchandise and he was providing time for his caregiver to grab items off the storage shelves leaving other people waiting.
256	That sounds frustrating, What did you do during the time you had to wait?
257	I tried to distract some little kids that were with their mother. By making silly faces at the kids and humming kids' songs, giving opportunities to the mom to relax in conversation and providing amusement for the kids and myself.
258	It
