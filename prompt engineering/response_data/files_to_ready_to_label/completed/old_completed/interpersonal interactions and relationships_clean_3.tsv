10	I'm fine, thank you for asking.
11	Is there anything interesting happened today?
12	Well, a gentleman at the store couldn't reach the item on the top shelf and looked like he was struggling. I offered to help him and he thanked me for it, that's about it.
13	That was very kind of you. Can you tell me more about it? How did it happen?
14	He wasn't tall enough to reach the item and no one was around to help him. I was a bit hesitant at first because of social distancing rules, but I thought nothing would happen if I upper the mouth mask and helped him - keeping Social change is quite difficult these

35	I wasn't sure which aisle the cereal was on, so I asked a store clerk. She seemed displeased by my question and barely helped me find it on the shelf.
36	That must have been frustrating. Did you say anything to her?
37	I didn't want to cause a scene so I just reiterated that I had difficulty finding it. I think it would've been easier if she just pointed me in the right direction.
38	Did it take a while for you to find the cereal?
39	Not too long. I discovered that

85	Well, they seemed a bit flustered and didn't really make eye contact with me when we talked.
86	Hmm, that's interesting. Have you noticed anything like that before in your interactions with them?

108	Ransacked? How did that happen? 
109	Someone broke into my glass back door in the job in and from the looks of it came straight up to my small safe unlock contraption and ransacked it. 
110	I'm so sorry that happened! Who did you call for help? 
111	It took me awhile to brave calling for medical intervention, so I finally got the guild legal head in charge named *his name*''' to here me. It seemed easier that way, dear :'. 
112	It's okay
113	--------------------
114	How have you been, lately?
115	To be honest, it's not been easy to manage things on my own.
116	What happened?
117	Every time I try to go outside and take a walk, I become overwhelmed keeping track of everything going on around me and sometimes unclear about which way turn and look confused infront of the strangers.
118	Is there any specific event?
119	A few days ago, I needed to shop for griving parents present but lost and unable remembering which gift my parents hide to avoid spend too much in these live case.

128	No, I didn't have any problem. The employee easily helped me find it.
129	That's great to hear. Well done!

136	Oh really, what happened?
137	I attempted to strike a casual conversation with my neighbor today and ended it awkwardly. 
138	I'm sorry to hear that, what happened exactly?
139	Yah, well I asked him if he had received the package I brought him due to not seeing him since then- he told me yes, with a curt tone and started to turn away towards his doorstep implying unwillingness to speak with me any longer.
140	That's unfortunate. Was he busy doing something at that time when you made conversation?
141	No, not really... that's another

145	That's great! were you able to go to your destination smoothly.
146	Yes for the most part. The driver mistook my request for a corner intersection, and I ended up getting lost for a few minutes.

148	No, it's my fourth time using the route in 3 weeks, I normally have encounters similar to this.

198	Both couple friends had exciting trips planned but I didn't get an invite to either. 
199	That does sound difficult. How do those instances make you feel?
200	I kinda felt left out, like they enjoy each other's company more? 
201	Is this kind of thing usual or remarkable?
202	No, come to think of it I'm usually included, it made me feel deflated.
203	How do you typically cope with these kinds of situations?

217	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! Did you end up resolving the issue and seeing the movie?

223	Well, yes, I had an encounter with Mrs. Johnson at the grocery store.
224	Ok, tell me more about that interaction.
225	I think it didn't go well. I wasn't quite sure how to start the conversation, and I probably came across as excessively serious.
226	Understandable. When did you mention the items you were purchasing to Mrs. Johnson?
227	To be exact? I actually eliminated them after Mrs. Johnson picked up a dozen bagels.
228	That is occasion for a scheme opener! Keep any enquiries like how many people the bagels will feed or the requested zip concentrate amount. Did you give a polite exc
229	--------------------

231	It was an okay day today. But has not been that great most of the week.
232	Oh no, what happened? Is there anything that's got you troubled at the moment?
233	Well, not really anything troubling but my children haven't been picking up my calls much in the past week.
234	That is worrying! What type of calls? Are you okay? Did they reply afterwards?
235	Channeling feelings emotions towards positive responses will always herald the smooth communication methods between dynamic heterogeneous flow problems inter and intrapersonaly without mixing consequensies. Am pretty sure.
236	F : I am not exaggerating when l tell you that not
237	--------------------
238	How was your day today?
239	It was fine, nothing much happened
240	Really? Did you talk to anybody today?
241	Yes, actually I did. I ran into my neighbor this morning.
242	Oh, that's nice! Did you exchange any words with them?
243	Yes, we talked for a little bit. We mostly just discussed the weather!
244	Ah, that's always a good topic. Did you engage in any other interactions throughout the day?
245	Well, I did make a quick stop at the store. I had to ask the cashier for some help finding a particular item I couldn't locate on my own.
246	Good for you
247	--------------------
248	How has your day been going so far?
249	Pretty good, thanks for asking. Did something doozy happen last week that messed up a companionship. 
250	What happened? 
251	Well my neighbor and I usually exchange pleasantries and yesterday, they didn't even acknowledge me when we crossed like no one recent observed me crossing moreover they did not show impressed meeting with me. 
252	Definitely a weird experience. Maybe your neighbor was just having a bad day? 
253	I thought to let go of it at that point however the way of respite gave compleing doubts as met sometimes after hope of neighbors raising hands with greeting but on and similarly happening pulled the trigger horn of major benldowns.
254	--------------------
255	How was your day today?
256	It wasn't bad, thank you for asking. 
257	Was there anything particular that happened?
258	I had to take a trip to the grocery store. 
259	Was it busy there? 
260	Oh yes, I dread going on busy days. 
261	Was anyone helpful or kind to you during your trip?
262	I suppose the cashier was polite and helped bag my groceries, but I ended up throwing fruits into the backyard of their form of laziness.
263	Why did you do that?
264	They won’t be watched over all!
