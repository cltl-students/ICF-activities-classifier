261	How have things been going for you lately?
262	Hmm, every early morning when I wake up, it takes me some time to actually get out of bed. I just don't seem to have as much energy has I used to.
263	That seems understandable, how about once you do get going later in the morning?
264	Once I'm up, I manage to cook breakfast, turn on the morning news and get through some usual tasks around the house, but I've noticed I'm not as fast as I used to be. By the time I'm done, I can only manage for like an hour before feeling more appetite.
