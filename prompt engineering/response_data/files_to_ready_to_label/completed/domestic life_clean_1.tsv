191	Oh, how did you make your choice? It must have been tough for you.
192	Indeed, it’s rarely easy to choose home furnishings with limited budget these days. I usually just go with function over appearance. This weekly home affair has been my top challenge.
193	Please do go on. Do you tale environment, scrap in here? Does following your heart serve as etnniceelement? Is quantiton as core coming to paying?

215	--------------------
216	How have things been around the house lately?
217	Oh, I get tired so easily. It's difficult to keep everything tidy.
218	I see. Do you have someone to help you out with errands?
219	My granddaughter comes by once a week and picks up some things such as my medicine. Other than that, no.
220	Have you thought about hiring a home aide to give you support?
221	Honestly, I'm not sure how they'd be able to guarantee whether somebody could adapt accordingmy needs. How would hiring a home aide facilitate my mundane chores differently from other people?

233	--------------------
234	So, how are things going at home these days? It seems like we haven't caught up in a while.
235	Well, I'm managing things one day at a time. It's hard to keep up sometimes.
236	I understand, can you give me a little glimpse into what you mean by that?
237	Sure, for example, recently I tired to clean the gutters by myself and I almost fell from the ladder.
238	Oh no, when did this happen?
239	Just a few days ago. Luckily, my grandson heard me shouting for help and came running to the rescue.
240	I see. Maybe it's best to hire a professional to handle difficult tasks like that.
241	I couldn't
242	--------------------
243	Hey there, how's everything going with you today? 
244	Oh, I'm doing just fine, thank you!

246	Well, not much lately, but I did buy some new curtains last month. 
247	Oh, that's nice. Did you have trouble getting that done at all? 
248	Not really, it was pretty straightforward. I just went to the department store that I always go to and picked them out. 
249	Was there anything in particular you were looking for? 
250	Yes, I needed something with a lot of visual interest so that it wouldn't be too plain-looking when hanging in the window. 
251	--------------------
252	How are you doing? I happened to be in the neighborhood and thought of stopping by.
253	Oh, that's very kind of you. I'm good. How about you?
254	I'm pretty good too. I was curious, how are you managing with cooking these days?
255	I usually try to cook every day, but sometimes, it becomes a bit challenging because I get tired quickly. So I like to prepare easy meals, or buy groceries that are convenient to cook [B NF].
256	That's understandable. And what time are you used to starting the cooking?
257	I prefer to start cooking around 3:00 pm, so the meal is ready by 6:00 pm,
