0	Hi, it's great to see you today. How are you doing?
1	Hi. I'm doing okay.
2	You mentioned last time that you have difficulty with your mobility. Can you tell me more about that?
3	Yes, it's been challenging. I find it hard to lift heavy things.
4	When do you experience these difficulties with lifting?
5	It happens mainly in the morning when I try to carry groceries from the shop.
6	Is there anything specific that led to these challenges?
7	Maybe it's because I'm getting old because it was never this hard trying to carry morning groceries.
8	Would you say that abdominal lifts are just as difficult?' 
9	No, abdominal lifts have
10	--------------------
11	Hi there, how's your day going?
12	Not too bad, a little tired from the morning activities.
13	What sort of activities did you do this morning?
14	Well, I woke up and got dressed by walking to the closet for my clothes. I then made breakfast, which involved reaching for a bowl and pouring cereal. I also have to prop up a chair against the wall to give me a place to rest among other things.
15	That sounds like quite a few different tasks that require mobility. Is there any particular one that you find more challenging than the others?
16	 P: Well, sometimes carrying groceries can be difficult even when it's not that far of a walk.
17	I can see how that
18	--------------------
19	How have you been doing lately?
20	I have difficulty with some of these everyday things. 
21	What kind of activities?curious gesture
22	Well, actually when I lift something moderately heavy either up or via bringing it near to me easilytightly—-that’s difficult: such steps could instigate pain and obstructation around shoulder bones..
23	When would your problem begin to appear? When lifting something really heavy above your comehand-length? or nearing the distant-end towards you remain difficultor something different?
24	No, it occur while performing tasks in everyday life:more than hand level-wt item, mostly doing such more frequentlyever small objects produce uncomfortableinstability.
25	--------------------
26	Hi there. How are you today?
27	I am good, just a little tired.
28	That sounds reasonable. Can you share a bit about your daily life and how you perform your tasks?
29	Yes, lately carrying grocery has become really difficult for me.
30	Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that, when do you normally carry groceries? 
31	Twice a week. Every Tuesdays and Fridays. 
32	I see. And how do you usually carry them?
33	I tend to use a paper bag for all my groceries, but this has become more difficult and challenging.
34	Have you thought about bringing reusable bags or dividing your groceries into multiple, lighter weight bags? 
35	--------------------
36	How are you feeling today?
37	Oh, not so good. I have been experiencing difficulties in moving my arms.
38	I see. When exactly did you start having difficulties with your arm mobility?
39	It started last week while I was attempting to move the lightweight curtains in my living space. But then, I good find good support for opening and closing windows equally way that could place my arms furthere away without falling over . 
40	That sounds terrible. Has it happened again then?
41	Yes, few days ago while I was attempting to pick and lift pot when truing on fire having bait steaming. Now lately I started to linger longer with pot on table until it was caoted on. However no one
42	--------------------
43	How are you today?
44	Oh, not bad. And yourself?
45	I'm great, thanks for asking. Could you tell me what you did yesterday?
46	Of course, I woke up early in the morning and got myself out of my bed.
47	How do you manage to do that? 
48	I use the bed rail to pull myself upright then turn my legs to rest them down on the floor.
49	Shower or have breakfast yet? 
50	Not yet. Usually, I put my pull up the bed because is because more comfy to get onto it after a shower but last day I jdecided onto maOnt be on Upwing over my Pull Ups tightly so that it would stay on
51	--------------------
52	Hi, how are you today?
53	Oh, I’m okay. Thank You.
54	I remember we talked about mobility earlier i hope it didn’t cause you difficulties, can you walk normally like you used to do before on daily basis?
55	No I can’t
56	oh no! In what way has your mobility caused difficulties for you? 
57	Sometimes even get out of bed lile I used to is painful, also inability lock my stairs so I can't go search for things if it wasn't at hand-level, lastly, waving in the street level can be surprisingly competitive 
58	Oh No Resting and allowing enough synthesis in your system is might solve this issue slightly, have you noticed what
59	--------------------
60	Do you do any lifting or carrying in your daily life? 
61	Yes, I have to carry groceries whenever I go grocery shopping. 
62	That's understandable, how frequently do you go grocery shopping in a week? 
63	I go two times a week. 
64	I see. During those groceries to reach your place, would you walk carrying or pushing a rolling cart for your purchases? 
65	Usually, I carry them until the cart becomes vacant and I put every item there then commence walking by pushing them.
66	How often do you find yourself kicking any specific object on a regular basis while, for example, you are standing, waiting around, or during leisure activities like playing ball?
67	Actually
68	--------------------
69	Do you feel comfortable with your mobility on a daily basis? 
70	Yes and no. Although I can still walk, but I can't do some things by myself anymore. 
71	What kind of activities do you find difficult? 
72	Well, lifting any weight is out of the question. And I can no longer kick a ball. 
73	When did you first start to notice these limitations? 
74	I suppose it's only been around the last year or two? Came on slowly with being unable to do small things and then got worse. 
75	Do you give piggyback rides to your grandchildren? 
76	Unfortunately, I can't anymore. My daughter or granddaughter now would help assist me
77	--------------------
78	Can you tell me some of the things you do every day?
79	I usually wake up at 7 am and get out of bed.
80	And how do you get out of bed?
81	Sometimes I roll myself off and push myself up onto my knees. Other times, I’ll use my left hand to push myself up.
82	Do you do any exercises after that?
83	Yes, I do some simple exercises to stretch and move my arms and legs while reading the morning news.
84	What do you do for your breakfast later?
85	I usually have a muffin for breakfast, but it is hard to reach it from the counter, so I use a grabber-arm to get it down.
86	--------------------
87	How was your day today?
88	Not too bad, but I had trouble carrying my groceries upstairs.
89	What happened? Did you drop something?
90	No, I just found it difficult to carry the bags up by myself. It's getting harder by the day.
91	Have you tried using a shopping cart or asking someone for help?
92	Yeah, I have a cart, but when it comes to the stairs, I just can't maneuver it on my own. And there's no one around to help me.
93	I see. How about your daily walks?
94	It's going okay, but I slow down at times and also take more stops than I would like.
95	Are there specific types
96	--------------------
97	Hey! How have you been spending your days?
98	Not very active since I had an accident a while ago.
99	Oh no, I'm really sorry to hear that. Does it impact your mobility functions as well?
100	Yes, I struggle especially with carrying items up the stairs.
101	Oh, so you have to carry things often at your living place. How frequently you need to handle it per day?
102	Daily, because there is no elevator, even though I restarted fitness moments ago with help.
103	That can be a lot to manage. Can I ask if there's any assistance that provided through worker or family?
104	Sometimes my sister helps me carry baguals but after her bedtime, nobody
105	--------------------
106	Hi there, how was your day going so far?
107	Oh, it's been okay. A little exhausting.
108	I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything in particular that's making it more exhausting?
109	Just some general stiffness and fatigue. It seems like anytime I do any activity involving using my hands I have a tough time later on.
110	I can relate to that. Could you tell me more about it? Like, when does it usually happen and how do you feel when it does?
111	Sure. Usually it'll start a little while after I've been doing something. For example this morning it was while I was cleaning my table. Just gripping and moving some

115	Can you tell me what did you do yesterday?
116	Well, let me think...oh, in the morning, I had difficulty walking to the restroom because it's quite far.
117	Why was it?
118	It took me a while because my knee joint persisted pain from standing too much, and plus it was a bit swollen in the morning.
119	I see; what motions were difficult to do?

122	What kind of activities do you usually do at home that involve movement?
123	Well, I like to garden in the yard when the weather is nice.
124	That's great! What type of movements do you perform when gardening?
125	I often have to crouch down to fully engage with the soil, and I use a lot of upper and lower body strength to lift heavy things like bags of soil.
126	Do you need to use any tools to assist you with your gardening?
127	Yes, when the yard requires significant upkeep post-autumn there are a lot of leavesstemsagave spikes all interconnected in bundles that the typical landscaper's bag would hardly accomodate Any Wheelbarrow has the tandem balance not to

136	seldom but if things only needs lower trunk movement could still do it., lifting box of books
137	--------------------
138	What do you usually do before breakfast every morning?
139	I try to sit on the living room chair and lift my feet from the ground using my hand.

141	I take my therapy weight which looks like a can and lift on slow motion over my head with left then right arms.
142	What about before you sleep at night? Do you do bed mobilization?
143	Yes, I kind of stand desk beside my bed putting pressure on whichever side is pull of strongly.

150	They are only small flower beds, so I could lift and pour quickly and easily.
151	How do you usually handle your laundry and grocery shopping?

161	How often would you relocate? 
162	Often, like ingevery 3 to am4 hours, giennally speaking. 
163	Do you move anything while you relocate yourself?

181	I usually try to walk for at least 20 minutes in the neighborhood even if it hurts sometimes.
182	That's impressive. Do you take breaks during your walk or walk steadily through its duration?
183	I try to walk steadily as continuous sparing walks are theoretically and practically promising and will positively vent my mood.
184	That's good to hear. Do you find walking helpful in getting things done during the day or does it cause pain that is immobilising and prevents independence
