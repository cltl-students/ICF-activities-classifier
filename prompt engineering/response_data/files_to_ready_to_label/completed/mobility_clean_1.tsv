199	I first try to turn over and sit up before finally swinging out my legs from the bed.
200	That sounds hard, do you have someone to help you?
201	Thankfully no, it would be embarrassing if somebody always needed to help me.
202	How about getting in and out of chairs as well as walking from one side of the room to another?

214	Have you been feeling more difficulties with your daily walks?
215	Yes, my knees hurts when I walk and it’s harder to lift from sitting now.
216	I see. That sounds tough. When does the pain usually start?
217	It begins whenever I start putting pressure on them. But it stays if I’ve gotten up as well numerous times during the day.
218	Right. Do you have any constructive tactics that helps you tend with the neuropathy?
219	Crouching when grabbing needed thing can aid, as well as appearing when raising during sessions watching out for my back.

237	Understandable. When sitting for the longer duration, is there any difficulty then?
238	No, sitting for awhile doesn't give me an issue.
239	That makes sense. How are transfers when you move from bed to chair or when you drop something and selecting it off
240	--------------------
241	How is your day going so far?
242	It's been alright so far, thank you.
243	Have you had to do any particularly mobility-intensive tasks today?

245	When was the first time you had to get up?
246	I got up about an hour ago to make myself breakfast. Standing there for too long wasn't great for my knees.
247	I see. And have you had to transfer yourself anywhere?
248	I generally try to only go from my chair to my bed as my hip tends to act up a lot after walking distances or too often.
