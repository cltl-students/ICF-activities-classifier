0	How was your day today?
1	Oh it's been an interesting day. Early this morning I went to the grocery store.
2	What happened at the store?
3	I couldn't find any free shopping carts, so I asked a woman who just returned one where I could find one.
4	Did she help?
5	Yes, she told me that each slot has different storage, so try checking. Then she offered to take my coupons.
6	It's good to meet helpful people at the store! What else did you do?
7	After lunch, I visited the hobby I’m part of and talked with potential new members. We politely conversed about the different creatures in my collection pointed-to and relieved them whatever
8	--------------------
9	So how has your week been?
10	Overall it's been good, but I had kind of an awkward encounter this afternoon actually.
11	Awkward encounter? What happened, tell me more about it?
12	Well, I was in line at the grocery store, and I wasn't paying much attention and accidentally cut in line ahead of someone who then called me out on it in front of everyone.
13	That does sound a little embarrassing. Did you apologize and quickly move to the back of the line?
14	yes, Yes, definitely. I was surprised that I cut line and made a mistake, Never meant to do it, but the guy acted very angry.
15	Oof, did that make things better
16	--------------------
17	Hey, how are you feeling today?
18	I'm bored, to be honest.
19	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you could tell me about something you've done today?
20	I had a chat with one of my neighbors earlier.
21	That sounds nice. How did it go?
22	It was alright. We mostly talked about how their vegetable garden is coming along.
23	That sounds like a pleasant conversation. Did you initiate it?
24	Yes. I was outside checking the mail, and they were out in their garden at the same time.
25	Great. Did you learn anything interesting?
26	They offered me some fresh cucumbers that they just picked. Can't wait
27	--------------------
28	Good morning! How are you doing today?
29	Hello! I'm doing okay. It’s been an interesting few days.
30	Really, why is that? 
31	I started talking to a neighbour for the first time. I saw the neighbour outside and started a conversation!
32	When did you start talking and what did you talk about?
33	 P: It happened yesterday, I just greeted them in the morning and started to ask some questions about their vegetable garden. It turns out we had some things in common!
34	Wow, that's so nice to have a pleasant conversation with a neighbour. How did you feel after talking to them? 
35	I felt pretty good; excieted to
36	--------------------
37	What did you do yesterday?
38	Yesterday, I went for a walk in the neighborhood park.
39	Did you talk with anyone at the park?
40	Yes, while I was walking in the garden, I met a few people and said hi to them.
41	Oh, what type of people were they?
42	They were just random people, maybe other people living nearby walking in the garden.
43	That's good, did you have a conversation with anybody in particular?
44	Yes actually, I talked to this lady with her dog that I see few times a week and we exchanged pleasantries.
45	It's good to hear that you spoke to her. What did you say to her?
46	--------------------
47	So how has your day been?
48	Well, it has been pretty good. Except for this one experience.
49	Oh no, what happened?
50	I went to the grocery store and wanted to ask the employee where to find some honey, but I guess I didn't speak loudly enough because they didn't seem to hear me.
51	Did you try asking someone else for help?
52	Yes, another person tried to help me, luckily.
53	Where else have you had similar interactions?
54	At church. Sometimes I can't quite understand what the priest is saying during his sermon.
55	Have you tried sitting closer or asking someone after the church service for clarification
56	--------------------
57	So, do you do any activities during the day that involve socializing with others like reading a newspaper or attending an event?
58	Yes, I usually read newspaper which I leave outside in the lobby, and a couple of residents divert from their trail to mourn and have a daily chitchat topic with 'happy'. Moreover, other hospice groups send holy bead-wearing attendants, unique veternians with carts, program groups zebra carts, mental hospitalized era dancers seated which shake bells.
59	That sounds really nice. Do you ever watch TV or movies with any of your friends from here ?
60	I occasionally stay seated outside multiple rooms including mutual friend's Jessie who itself next watches morning TV series except some remote squeezing
61	--------------------
62	What have you been up to lately? 
63	 P: I went to the park today.
64	 F: That sounds nice. 
65	 P: Yeah, I run into my ex-girlfriend there.
66	 F: Oh, how did that go?
67	 P: It was a little uncomfortable. 
68	 F: Did you guys talk?
69	 P: She said hi, but that was about it.
70	 F: Can I ask what happened?
71	 P: We broke up about a year ago.
72	 F: I’m sorry to hear that.
73	 P: The relationship was just not working out.
74	 F: Have you been dating anyone else since?
75	 P: Not really, just going out with some friends.
76	--------------------
77	Hi, any interesting stories you have from the past few days?
78	Yes, actually something quite embarrassing happened to me at the grocery store the other day.
79	Really? What happened?
80	Well, I was having trouble finding a certain product so I asked one of the employees for help. I couldn't hear her very well from behind our masks...
81	Ah, I've had that trouble before!
82	Anyway, I had quite a hard time understanding her so I said ‘what？’ multiple times before it clicked to me that I might just botch her messages, of which when I realized that she was someone for whom English was a second-language… and my hearing certainly isn't as good as it used
83	--------------------
84	What did you do today, did you talk with anyone you know?
85	Yes, I went to the store today and I had to ask for help finding an item.
86	Oh, did you find the item alright?
87	Yes, but it took a while for the store clerk to lead me in the right direction.I'm not really familiar with the layout of the store.
88	Did you have a lot of trouble looking for it? 
89	No there was no trouble in that part, I just couldn't find a way around the differ places, nor could they find it very deep,hence the need of the clerk,would returned him to be task complet.I appreciate his kind talkement.
90	Great,
91	--------------------
92	What did you do yesterday, and did you meet with anyone special?
93	Usually, my daily routine is in the morning, I go for yoga and the community park. After this, I go grocery shopping and take medications. I met one teenager person in the bus who was having difficulty to comfort himself.
94	That looks interesting. When and how did you notice that teenager?
95	Yesterday is after when I have done community park. It comes on its route when taking medication.
96	Oh right. How were you traveling that day, bus?
97	Indeed, the teenager manages to sit beside me in a full-strike bus. He found irritation speaks out unusual devotional mantras.
98	Therefore, how did you
99	--------------------
100	Hi, how are you doing today?
101	I'm good, thank you for asking. How about you?
102	I'm okay. I've noticed that interacting with people sometimes get harder the older you get.
103	Oh, why do you think so?
104	When I was young, I had tons of energy to go out and interact with people. Now, I often feel challenged in gently approaching strangers to start up conversations, especially without any given common experiences the both parties could relate to.
105	Yeah, it definitely feels harder to connect with strangers sometimes.
106	Definitely, travelling on public transport could be stressful if it full of spectators struggling to accept they see world with perception tunaled and filter important close not societal
107	--------------------
108	How was your day, Jean? 
109	It was fine, Judy. I talked with my neighbor today. 
110	That’s great! What did you talk about? 
111	We talked about her garden. She showed me her new summer plants and I asked her where she got the seeds. 
112	Was she friendly? 
113	Yes, very. 
114	Was it easy to keep the conversation going? 
115	Yes, she's easy to talk to. 
116	Did you learn about new plants that you want to create a garden with? 
117	Yes, actually. She showed me a new plant and I can't wait to include it in my garden. 
118	When will
119	--------------------
120	So how's your day been so far, still coping with COVID?
121	Yes, it’s just been mundane. Nothing very exceptional. 
122	It doesn't sound like you had a lot to make out of your day. Letme ask do you run together with local Senior Runners’ Clubhere in our state?
123	Oh, really that's been awhile, my knee wouldn't allow me to, but I can be joined the city's yoga center for seniors she shared _laughing. How about have you join one? when did you start running said __ .
124	I understand, no worry, ive got lots of Fitness subscriptions exerscape, trim.io who can share best option closest to your

126	How has your day been going, Mrs. Johnson?
127	Oh, not too bad, thank you. How about yourself?
128	Doing well! What sorts of interactions with others have you had so far today?
129	Well, I called my daughter this morning to check in on her and chat. Then I spoke with my neighbor when we crossed paths heading outside to check the mail.
130	That's great to hear you regularly touch base with family and friends. How did the conversation with your daughter go?
131	Good, we caught up on her recent trip. She went to California for a work conference. It sounded interesting.
132	It's always fun to hear exciting experiences! What kind of interaction took place between you
133	--------------------
134	How was your day yesterday?
135	It was not bad.
136	Did you meet anyone new?
137	No, I didn't meet anyone new
138	Ok ... did you happen to engage in a conversation with anyone?
139	Sure, bumped into a friendly woman on the street. We had small conversation for a few minutes. 
140	That sounds nice. Was it easy to keep the conversation going for those few minutes?
141	Yes, she showed genuine interest in what I had to say, and asked questions calmly to get more insight into it.
142	That's great to hear. When you engage in a conversation, like that today, do you happen to initiate the discussion first, or is it always some
143	--------------------
144	Hi, how are you today?
145	I'm doing alright, thank you.
146	That's good to hear. I was just curious, have you had any interesting interactions with others recently?
147	Yes, actually. Just yesterday, my neighbor came over to chat for a little bit.
148	Oh really? How did that go?
149	It was great! We talked about our gardens and shared some tips.
150	That sounds lovely. What did you do afterwards?
151	We actually exchanged some contact information and made plans to get together sometime soon.
152	That's wonderful to hear! How did you feel during the interaction?
153	Honestly, a little nervous at first since we haven't talked much before.
154	--------------------
155	Can you tell me about one of your recent interactions with your neighbor?
156	Sure, it was two days ago. My neighbor came to visit me.
157	That’s nice. Did you invite your neighbor over or did she drop by without warning?
158	No, she dropped by for a chat. It was unexpected.
159	I see. What did you talk about?
160	Well, mostly about the neighborhood. I enjoyed hearing about their day and got caught up with a bit of gardening talk.
161	That sounds pleasant. Did you offer anything to your neighbor eg.tea, coffee, or a snack?
162	Yes, certainly I did, and they were so saucy trying to ask for wine
163	--------------------
164	How's your day today?
165	Oh, it's been just the same as other days.
166	Any interesting social interaction you had today?
167	Not really. But yesterday after my regular morning walk, I stopped by my neighborhood cafe and had a little chat with the barista.
168	Oh, how was the conversation? Did you guys talked about anything interesting?
169	Nothing in particular, we mostly talked about the weather, and they asked me about my plans for the day.
170	Interpersonal interactions like this often make for a meaningful connection. Do you regularly meet with your neighbors when you go out for your walk?
171	Pretty much. I usually meet Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins and we exchange greetings and
172	--------------------
173	Hey there, how have things been going for you lately?
174	Not too bad, I suppose. Though something rather strange happened the other day. 
175	What happened, could you tell me more about it?
176	I was shopping at the grocery store like usual, and bumped into a neighbor I haven't seen in a while.
177	Okay, did you guys get to catch up at all? 
178	We did, for a bit anyways. I think it was a bit muddled though, I wasn't sure when to stop asking questions. So at a certain point the conversation felt like it stalled - and ultimately it turned juuuuuust a little awkward get-together just trailed off surprisingly rapidly… like I
179	--------------------
180	Hey, it's good to see you today. How did your day go yesterday?
181	It went alright I suppose, though a bit stressful at times.
182	What happened?
183	Well, I had to run some errands and I found it hard to communicate with the cashier at the supermarket.
184	What was difficult about communicating?
185	Well, they spoke really fast and didn't give me much time to understand and respond. I also found it hard to hear them because of some background noises.
186	That can be frustrating. Did you manage to make the purchase and resolve the situation?
187	Yes, it took a bit longer than usual but ultimately I was able to
188	--------------------
189	Hi there! How was your day today? 
190	Oh, it was fine. Nothing too exciting happened. 
191	Did you happen to go out and talk with anyone? 
192	Yes, actually. Earlier today, I needed some help picking out some new clothes.
193	Ah, I see. Where did you go to get clothes? 
194	I went to that little boutique on 4th street. They were super helpful. 
195	That's nice. How did you interact with the people working at the boutique? 
196	Oh, they were very friendly and warm and welcomed me. First, they showed me new shirts arriving the latest arriving fashion types and kindly made some recommendations based on my color
197	--------------------
198	Hey, how are you today?
199	Oh, hello. I've had a good day, thanks.
200	That's great! What have you been up to today?
201	I had an interaction with the mail carrier today. She stopped by around noon and we had a little chat.
202	That's nice. What did you talk about?
203	She delivered a package for me and I was just asking about her day and any new developments on the block.
204	Did anything interesting happen during the conversation?
205	Not really. It was just a short conversation. She's very efficient and gets about her business.
206	How did you converse? Did she talk clearly?
207	Yeah, I could hear her
208	--------------------
209	Hey there, how's it going today?
210	Oh, you know I’m just living the retired life!
211	I understand. have you had any interactions with people that frustrated or angered you recently? 
212	Yes, my daughter called and asked for something yesterday. I agreed to do what was asked of me, but they kept interrupting while trying to explain so we could optimize function together....
213	they didn’t act respectful while talking with you or took direction well?
214	Exactly ! They needed to understand the significance.....
215	I get what you’re saying. That’s so annoying. what did you do?
216	I told X that they indeed serving me valuable stated my limit deline-cool
217	--------------------
218	Hey, how was your day today?
219	Oh, it was good. I went to the grocery store to get some things.
220	That sounds nice. Did you talk to anyone while you were there? 
221	Yes, I asked a store employee where the milk was.
222	And how did that go? 
223	It went fine. They were polite and showed me where to find it. 
224	That's great to hear. How about yesterday, did you have any social interactions then? 
225	Yes, actually, I talked to my neighbor for a bit when I went outside to check my mail.
226	That's good. Did you talk about anything interesting with them?
227	Not really
228	--------------------
229	So, have you had any interactions with people outside your family lately?
230	Yes, I went to the grocery store yesterday.
231	Oh, that's great! Did you talk to anyone while you were there?
232	Just the cashier, but it was a lovely conversation.
233	That's nice to hear. What did you talk about?
234	We chatted about the beautiful weather we've been having and how crowded the store is lately.
235	A weather chat is always a classic one! Did anyone else approach you while you were there?
236	Yes, a young man asked me if I needed help picking out melons since there were a lot to choose from, but I declined.
237	That's understandable
238	--------------------
239	How was your day yesterday, anything interesting happen? 
240	I went to the grocery store and had a nice talk with the cashier. 
241	That sounds nice, when and how did that happen? 
242	It happened in the afternoon. While the cashier was scanning my items, I suddenly thought that I wanted to cheer up because buying monthly groceries is such a serious business. To make her smile, I said something genuinely funny and she didn't soldier but rather loved it and threw another comeback. 
243	That's great to hear that! It sounds like you are doing well in your social skills recently! But were there any awkward moments during that conversation? 
244	Yeah actually there kind of like were some handful products
245	--------------------
246	Hello, how are you doing today?
247	Doing fine.
248	Were you able to go out yesterday?
249	Actually, I planned to visit my son's house yesterday. 
250	That's lovely! How did you end up meeting your journey?
251	I walked ten blocks down the street to take the cab. 
252	Did you have to talk to the driver and ask him where he could take you?
253	Yes, that is for sure. I had to awkwardly ask him what destinations he was heading in, and had to remember his instructions amidst that taxi noise!
254	Oh, I totally understand the hustle. It makes one’s temperature hike even higher. Well, was the journey comfortable, then
255	--------------------
256	What did you do yesterday?
257	I went to the supermarket to buy groceries in the morning.
258	That's great. Do you like the people you usually meet there?
259	Yes, there is one cashier that is very friendly and helpful. She's always smiling and making small talk with me.
260	That sounds nice. How did you converse with her this time?
261	I asked her how her day was going and commented on the long line-up. She talked about being busy during Christmas season.
262	Wow, it's poignant that you shared an effortless conversation without meaning to buy healthier food, how was cashier's reaction
263	She fullypartpart-than verbally commended my judicious finding of alternatives
264	--------------------
265	Friend: What are some of the events or situations that occur within your daily life that involve some sort of interpersonal interaction?
266	Patient: Well, I encounter people every day who engage with me about everyday activities. Specifically speaking my grocery runs leave me politely asking for prices and best selections. 
267	Friend: And how do you think you typically perform within these informal type-based interactions? Patient: My shoulders sways the joints with grace whilst my facial screws-up the worries: this portray ensures an articulation of clarity in oral and especially prompted expression such as prices pricing for nuts on a daily basis .
268	Friend: Have you found any challenges as per say dealing with strangers in your day to day looking in consideration of your age?
269	Patient: Sometimes stereotypes may lead
