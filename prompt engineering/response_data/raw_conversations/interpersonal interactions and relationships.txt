F: How was your day, by the way?
P: Not bad, but my neighbor is really difficult to deal with.
F: What makes you say that?
P: Well, she's really demanding and won't give me any space.
F: Hmm, that must be frustrating. How do you usually handle it?
P: I try to avoid her as much as possible, but sometimes you can't avoid it.
F: Have you tried to talk to her about it?
P: Yes, on several occasions actually. But she seems to completely dismiss everything I say.
F: That sounds tough, perhaps you could also involve a third party like a mediator to help resolve the issue?
P: That's a good idea. I'll
----------
F: How has your day been so far?
P: Not too bad, thank you for asking.
F: Did you do anything interesting today?
P: Yes, I was talking to my next-door neighbor.
F: oh, how was your conversation?
P: It was fine until we started talking about politics.
F: That can be a touchy subject. What happened?
P: We have different opinions and things started to intensify really fast. 
F: How did you handle it?
P: I tried to keep my voice low and calm down. However, we still ended up disagreeing and ending the conversation.
F: Well, handling disagreement in discussions can be a good way to practice keeping tensions low.
P: Yes,
----------
F: What did you do yesterday, Mrs. Johnson?
P: Yesterday was a busy day for me. My neighbor asked me to water her plants while she's out of town, so I went to her house in the morning.
F: That was kind of you. Did you have a chance to interact with anyone else during the day?
P: Yes, I stopped by the supermarket on my way home. While I was standing in line I saw a lady I used to know from church, so we chatted a little bit.
F: That must have been nice to catch up with her. Were there any challenges when you were talking with the lady?
P: Well, she was asking me about some recent events in the church, but
----------
F: How was your day today? Anything interesting happen?
P: It was a decent day. Nothing interesting, really.
F: I see. Well, how about yesterday? Anything noteworthy?
P: Actually, I went for a walk in the park.
F: Oh, that's nice! Did anything interesting happen while you were there?
P: There was an unruly child who was aggressively pushing past everyone on the busy footpath.
F: That must have been frustrating. How did you handle it?
P: I simply kept a safe distance and chose another path.
F: That seems like a wise decision. Anything else happen whileyouwere on your walk? 
P: Not really but did see another senior pakrer singing along with
----------
F: Can you tell me more about your day today?
P: I am always in the room. No one speaks with me, and I don't want to bother them.
F: That sounds difficult for you.
P: Sometimes I try to say hello to people but they seem too busy or don't hear me.
F: Has this been happening frequently?
P: Every time I leave my room, really. I am used to it.
F: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you mentioned this to anyone here before?
P: Yes, many times. But the response was always a confused look on their face and saying they will do something about it. But it never changes.
F: That must be disappointing.  Have you
----------
F: How are you feeling today?
P: Oh, not too bad, thanks for askin'.
F: That's good to hear. Tell me, have there been any events in your daily life that challenged your abilities to interact with others?
P: Yes, take yesterday for instance. I had lunch with some old buds from work after a long while being apart from them. They were joking and laughing around like before, but some of their language left me feeling left out. 
F: What kind of language did they use that impacted you negatively?
P: It seemed injurious to minority groups that I belong to, which made me feel uncomfortable joining in their exchanges so often like we did at one time
F: That must have felt
----------
F: Hey, how was your day today? 
P: It was alright, nothing special.
F: Did any interesting interactions happen that you want to tell me about? 
P: Well, not particularly. I did go to the grocery store and the cashier was really friendly.
F: That's nice, how did you interact with them? 
P: I just made small talk and smiled. They asked me how my day was going and I answered. It was a small interaction but it made me feel good. 
F: That's great. Have you been experiencing any conflict with anyone lately? 
P: Actually my grandchild and I had a little disagreement the other day. 
F: Oh no, what happened? 
P
----------
F: How are things going with you?
P: Oh, hi. It's been tough these days.
F: What happened?
P: Yesterday, I went out to buy some groceries, but people seemed to block me.
F: Hmm, how is your communication with people usually like?
P: Well, generally I can communicate in a friendly and kind manner with others, but yesterday they refused to listen to my thought.
F: Maybe the other side has a special encounter. Did they share why this was happening?
P: No, no and sadly they refused gently sharing anything about their overall costumer-dependent principles that can be caused some authentic void about this utter dilemma.
F :Oh, so no comprehension occurred after composing some messages to request
----------
F: How was your day today?
P: Oh, it wasn't bad. 
F: Did anything interesting happen?
P: Actually, yes! I talked to a friend I hadn't spoken to in awhile.
F: That's great! Why did you reach out to them now? 
P: I had been feeling pretty down lately, and I missed having conversations with them about everyday life. So, I mustered up the courage to initiate a conversation with them.
F: That takes some real courage and initiative. How did the conversation go?
P: It went really well! My friend was super understanding and listened to everything I had to say. And even though it has been a little while since we spoke, everything felt really natural
----------
F: I see you seem a bit down today. How has your day been, my friend?
P: Well, not bad. It's just that my nephew came to visit and things didn't go too well.
F: What happened with your nephew?
P: He wanted to eat some cookies that belonged to one of my grandchildren, but I told him they were not for him. And then we ended up arguing.
F: Oh no, that doesn't sound pleasant. How did that make you feel?
P: I feel upset. He should understand and not be simple  while interacting with people staying with me. Eventually, residents of the of my caregiving require reliable assistance.
F& I understand. I myself find arguments hard to cope
----------
F: How was your day today?
P: Rather uneventful. I stayed home all day reading.
F: Oh, what book did you read?
P: It was a romance novel set in France.
F: That sounds interesting.. Was there anything interesting happening in the story?
P: Yes, the main character had a lot of conflict in her relationship with her boyfriend and made some bad decisions because of it.
F: How did you feel while reading those parts?
P: I can strongly relate to that kind of conflict as it often happened in my younger years when I was figuring out how to have relationships.
F: Can you think of a specific time when you had a similar conflict?
P: Sure. Around 25 years ago
----------
F: How was your day today, hows is your social interactions going?
P: It was okay. A caring person on the bus today actually got a seat for me on the bus.
F: Ah, that was nice. Where you headed today?
P: Just to the neighborhood dentist which was quite fine too.
F: That sounds like a good trip. Did you talk to anyone else on the way to the office?
P: And as it always come,' I was delayed by some previous uninvited company.' Nonetheless, Misses Nancy comes around properly - you cheer up conversing giver scubadoo who sounded friendly!'
F: That's great that you found some new acquaintance and that Miss Nancy was nice to converse with.
----------
F: Hi, how's everything going with you?
P: Well, nowadays I feel like I don't spend much time with my friends and loved ones.
F: Oh really? When did you begin to feel that way?
P: I think it started after I retired. I used to see my colleagues and old friends frequently, but now my life feels really still and lonely. My family members only call me occasionally and my old friends have moved to different cities for work.
F: I understand how that can be really difficult. Could you tell me about a specific example when you felt like your interactions with people might be affecting your relationships?
P: Sure thing. My daughter invited her whole family to come visit for vacation this year, including grandchildren
----------
F: How's it going today?
P: It's going alright. I had a friend come over yesterday for lunch.
F: That sounds nice. How did the visit go?
P: Well, at first it went well because my friend and I caught up. But then my friend started talking about politics and got very angry when I shared a different opinion than they did.
F: Oh, that's to be expected sometimes. How did you handle the situation?
P: I tried to calmly express my point of view, but my friend got louder and more demanding. I eventually just changed the subject to avoid further conflict.
F: I think that sounds like good conflict management.
P: Thank you. It's important to preserve the relationship,
----------
F: How has your day been going so far?
P: It has been okay. Same routine as always.
F: Have you engaged with anyone today?
P: Yes, I met with my neighbor this morning during my walk.
F: How did the interaction go?
P: It was a brief chit chat, nothing too meaningful. 
F: Do you usually have meaningful conversations with this person? 
P: Sometimes, but today I was in a bit of a rush. 
F: That's understandable. Did you regulate your emotions while speaking with them even though you were rushing?
P: Yes, I stayed calm and courteous.
F: That's great to hear. What else have you done today that involved interactions with others?

----------
F: Hi, how was your day today?
P: Well, it was okay.
F: Did you interact with anyone today?
P: Oh yes, my neighbor stopped by to say hello.
F: That's nice! How did that go?
P: It went well as usual.
F: Did you feel comfortable interacting with them?
P: Yes, my neighbor is a pleasant person to talk to, so no problem there.
F: Sounds like things went smoothly. Is this fairly typical of your interactions with people these days?
P: Yes, for the most part. As I've gotten older, I've developed my own ways of dealing with people, and most of the interactions I have are quite good.
F: That's great
----------
F: How are you doing today?
P: I am doing okay, just a little stressed out.
F: Is everything okay with work and home?
P: I am having some trouble with my roommate. She is not respecting my wishes.
F: How so?
P: Well, I have asked her multiple times to not leave her dirty dishes in the sink but she continues to do it.
F: That must be frustrating. Have you tried talking to her and expressing how her actions are affecting you?
P: Yes, but she seems to get defensive and it becomes an argument.
F: Maybe a change in approach would help. Have you tried using "I-messages" instead of blaming language like "you never listen"?
P: Hmm
----------
F: Hey! How are you today? 
P: I’m doing well, thank you. 
F: I’m glad to hear that. I noticed that you’ve been more active recently. Were there any incidents that caused you to be more outgoing? 
P: Yes actually, my daughter began taking me to dance classes at the community center!  
F: Oh that sounds fun -- How's your experience so fairment?
P: At first the group was in ha power because participant with chronic health conditions had difficulty clustering together to spontaneous dancing two at a time, but with e encouragement of ea pair dancing alongside had minor dialogues discussing experience, wellbeing my initiative encouraged my son increase support duetter    
F: It's understandable.  That
----------
F: How was your day today, Indra?
P: It was good. In all honesty though, I miss having company around as I feel life gets too isolated.
F: Oh, that's understandable. Have you thought about reaching out to join social groups like a club?
P: Yeah, I've thought about it, but at my age, it is easy to withdraw and keep to yourself wondering the pros without really there take or implising those feasible interactions. 
F: That makes sense. Back when you used to participate in group activities, how did you interact and maintain relationships within those groups? 
P: Generally well. Those relevant social interactions were largely was dependent on memories over a period that strengthened reasonably inevitable relationships. Its easy
----------
F: "Hey, how are you feeling today?"

P: "I'm doing alright, thank you for asking."

F: "That's good to hear. I'm always here to listen if you want to share anything."

P: "Actually, I've been thinking about my interactions with my family a lot lately. It feels like every time I see them, we end up arguing about something."

F: "I see. Can you give me an example of when this usually happens?"

P: "Well, a few weeks ago we all went out to eat together. My sister ordered onion rings and I made a comment about how she always picks greasy foods. She didn't take it as a joke and we started bickering back
----------
F: What have you been up to lately?
P: Not much exciting, but I went to the grocery store earlier.
F: Oh, that's good. How did interacting with the other people there go?
P: I guess it went fine. One woman let me go ahead of her in the checkout line.
F: That was nice of her. How did you respond to her?
P: I thanked her, of course, and asked how her day was going.
F: That was a friendly way to respond. Did she seem appreciative of the conversation?
P: Yes, she actually seemed a bit lonely and was really appreciative of the gesture.
F: That's good to hear. How did you feel having that conversation with

F: How was your day today? Did anything noteworthy happen?
P: Ohh, well it was a decent day nothing special, just ran usual errands.
F: I understand, but I recall once you went grocery shopping, you felt like the people in the bulk-buying line were inconsiderate, did something similar happen today? 
P: I actually felt really content letting a couple with kids selecting desk plates ahead of me.

----------
F: Can you tell me about something that happens in your daily life which reflects how you interact with others, like with your friends or family?

P: Well, every night, my family gets together for dinner. You could say it's our daily routine.

F: That sounds nice. How do you normally interact with your family during dinner?

P: Oh sure. During dinner, we usually talk about what happened during the day and how it was. Sometimes, my grandchildren tell stories about what is happening in the school.

F: Do you contribute to these dinner time discussions?

P: Yes. Actually, we can change our discussion about various things. Daily routine gave us different topics before.

F: Do you often see positive responses to your verbal
----------
F: How was your day? Anything special happen today?
P: Oh, it was a really lovely day. I was sitting at the park and one lady asked really nicely to share the bench. 
F: That's really nice to hear. How did you respond to her approach?
P: Well, I smiled and told her that she was welcome to sit with me.
F: That sounds great! Did the two of you end up talking for a bit?
P: Yes. It turned out that we had quite a lot in common and it was so nice just to sit and chat with someone!
F: That's wonderful to hear. Do you have any plans of meeting her again sometime?
P: Actually, we did exchange phone numbers
----------
F: Can you share an event or situation from your day today that involved interacting with someone else?
P: Yes, actually my caretaker came over to help me with some chores around the house earlier.
F: Oh nice, did you enjoy her company or do you not like having aides come to your house?
P: Overall, she was very nice and helpful but I did feel a bit misunderstood when I was trying to explain how to do something.
F: Can you tell me a bit more about that?  How was she not understanding and did she end up figuring it out eventually?
P: Well, I think perhaps my explanation was a bit confusing to begin with. However, instead of asking me clarifying questions, she immediately began doing
----------
F: Hey there! How was your day?
P: Not so good today. 
F: Really? Why is that?
P: My grandchild called today but I was unable to answer the phone due to my hearing issue.
F: That;s tough.. Did you talk to your child about that earlier?


P:Yes, I depend on them to leave a voicemail if I am not able to answer the call unlike my younhger months when I used hearing hardwares to enchance my belongingschaftions with others unfamiliar or had hearing losses and it sheikred my confidence deeply.

F: What's been happening in your daily life recently?
P: Oh, nothing much... Really just staying at home mostly.
F: I know! It's been hard to think of what to do with all this spare time. Do you happen to be having anyone come by?
P: Not really.
F: Is there a particular way that you want spends they time with you?

F: What did you do today?

P: Well, I met my new neighbor earlier.

F: Oh, really? That's nice. How did it go?

P: It went well, I think. We chatted for a little while about the weather and our pets.

F: That's great! Did you feel comfortable during the conversation?

P: Yes, I did. She made me feel at ease, and we seemed to have some common interests.

F: Did you find anything challenging about meeting your new neighbor?

P: Not really. Although, I did maintain distance, since we had Face mask mandate due to rising COVID tases in the area. Also Though there was spellng differance she showed care and lisening know
----------
F: Just wondering, how was your day today?
P: Not that great, I encountered a problem while shopping at the grocery store.
F: Oh, what happened? Could you tell me more about what happened?
P: I accidentally crashed my cart with another person while navigating through the crowded aisles.
F: That must have been embarrassing, Didi the other person react negatively when it happened?
P: No, fortunately, she was very sweet about it. She immediately assumed some responsibility too and exclaimed sorry.
F: That’s great she didn’t overreact and also took on partial blame. How did you feel after such event of interrupting someone's day and personal space?
P: Honestly, it really makes me anxious to think that
----------
F: How was your day today?
P: It was an okay day. I went to the grocery store to get some food I needed.
F: That's good. Did you interact with anyone at the store?
P: Yes, I did encounter a woman in my aisle who needed help reaching for an item on the top shelf.
F: Did you offer to help her?
P: Yes, I did offer her and got her the item she was looking for.
F: That was nice of you. What about the checkout process, did you communicate with the cashier?
P: Yes, I did. The cashier greeted me and I said hi back. I thanked her at the end when I was done checking out.
F: It seems
----------
F: How have you been feeling today?
P: Oh, just so so. Nothing too eventful happened. 
F: Well, how've things been with your family lately? 
P: Good, I had a dinner party yesterday in order to cope with difficult personal transitions within three months. The gathering wasn’t quite easy anytime two out of three spreekable event-triggered let's call it ‘really passionate political announcer monologes of obliviant uncle, threatening younger soberleisure sections by forming his mindset-contemporary stance’. I had to put things my way.  
F: I can understand how that must have been stressful. Did the dinner party go smoothly besides that conflict?
P: Overall, it was quite synchronizing and

F: "How was your day, did anything memorable happen today?"

P: "Oh dear, you know how visitors day went yesterday?"

F: "No, I wasn't informed. What exactly happened?"

P: "My granddaughter fell asleep half-way through meditation and I scolded her a little loudly on front of everybody... well, that's what struck  with me."

F: "I see. Could you have reacted differently, looking back?"

P: "What can I say - my pride gets the better half of me." 

F: "Since you recognize that pride is affecting your relationships event negatively in your  interpersonal networks, how can we pin down specific process steps to change that issue?"

P: "I’m really looking
----------
F: Hey, how was your day today?

P: Oh, it was fine, just like any other day.

F: Really? What did you do today?

P: I took a walk in the garden and saw some people feeding the ducks. I wanted to go closer and watch them but I thought it might not be appropriate to impose on strangers.

F: Well, that’s very responsible of you to think that way. Maybe they wouldn’t mind or even be happy to let you watch.

P: Yes, maybe you’re right. I always try to be respectful and considerate of others.

F: That’s really commendable! But don’t ever lose your sense of wonder about the things around you too.

P: Oh,
----------
F: Hi, how are you today?
P: Good, thanks for asking. How about you?
F: I’m doing well. Can you tell me about something interesting or meaningful that happened to you recently? 
P: Well, my son came to visit me last weekend. We watched some movies together.
F: That sounds nice. Did you both enjoy it?
P: Yes, we did. It's always nice to have him around but It was a bit difficult to choose what Movie to watch as our preferences are different.
F: I can understand. Did that cause any problem between you two?
P: No, we talked through our preferences, their ratings, and found something that we both was something we hadn’t seen yet and
----------
F: So, how has your day been so far?
P: It's been okay I guess.
F: Is there anything specific on your mind?
P: Yeah actually. Yesterday, my daughter came to visit me at the retirement home.
F: Ah, that sounds lovely! How did it go?
P: I was happy to see her of course. But some of her comments really annoyed me.
F: What kind of comments?
P: Well... She kept asking about aspects of how I live here as if she thought I'm hopeless by being passive around here.
F:How she went detail or specific expectations?, Did she explain with calm or became angry unable to understand that actions still represent responsibility?
P: Actually mostly things
----------
F: Good morning! How has your day been so far, anything interesting to share?
P: Oh, not really. Just trying to keep up with my routine like usual, you know.
F: I know what you mean. But despite the regiments, there must come events now and then worth telling others about, right?
P: Like what, though?
F: Well, I believe for elderly patients like you sometimes things can pop up involuntary in the foreground while having familiar conversations. Maybe when trying to following someone’s storytelling or trying to lead others in trying your favoured board game behaviours, in the cafe occasionally trying talking daily running beforehand smoothly with a variable barkeeper. For me eventually hair rising stands accompanying unbelievable overnight successes hearing awesome phone conversations
----------
F: How was your day today?
P: Oh it was alright, I had a nice chat with a neighbor this afternoon.
F: That's great to hear. Can you tell me about the conversation?
P: Well, we spoke about our gardens and the vegetables we like to plant. It was interesting to learn about different gardening techniques she used.
F: it looks like she's a nature lover! You've been living in this neighbourhood for a while, right?
P: Yes, I have. I feel more comfortable building connections with the people in my immediate vicinity as I see them more frequently around.
F: I can understand that. How about yesterday? Did you see your grandchild?
P: Yes, they came over for a
----------
F: How was your day today?
P: Oh, it was okay.
F: Just okay? What did you do?
P: Well, I had a doctor's appointment this morning. Then I came home and watched some TV.
F: That sounds pretty routine. Anything happen during your appointment?
P: Not really, just a check-up. The doctor asked how I've been feeling since my last visit.
F: Did you tell them about anything that's been bothering you lately?
P: Actually, yes. I mentioned I feel like I've been more forgetful lately.
F: And what did the doctor say?
P: They did some tests and told me it's probably just a part of aging. I didn't really like
----------
F: How's your day going so far?
P: It hasn't been too bad, just had a bit of trouble with my neighbor this morning.
F: Trouble? What happened?
P: Well, I have been trying to talk to him about something bothering me for the past few days but he never seems to listen.
F: That sounds frustrating. Did anything happen today?
P: Yeah, he completely disregarded what I was saying and walked away mid-conversation.
F: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you thought of any other approach to talk to him about your concern?
P: Yes, I plan on writing him a letter, maybe that way he will take the time to really listen to what I have to say.

----------
F: How are you feeling today?

P: Oh, I am doing well. Just feeling a bit sluggish.

F: I see, anything interesting happen to you recently?

P: Yes, actually. I was trying to make phone calls earlier today but was having trouble hearing the person on the other line.

F: That does sound frustrating. Did it impact your phone call much?

P: Unfortunately, yes. It made interacting socially through the phone much harder and really weighed on me.

F: That makes sense. When did you start experiencing hearing issues in your phone calls?

P: It started a few weeks ago and has started progressively causing me more troubles since I am struggling in catching some of sentences from my kin eard. 

F:
----------
F: How has your day been?

P: Not bad, but I'm having trouble keeping in touch with people lately.

F: Oh really? Did something happen that makes it hard to stay connected?

P: Well, I think I have a little trouble sometimes understanding when someone is just busy, or when they might be ignoring me.

F: That can definitely be tough. Do you ever check in with the person and ask if everything's okay?

P: Not typically. I feel like I don't want to bother them or push too much on something.

F: I can understand that, but sometimes it might be good to just communicate openly. That way, both parties can share their thoughts and feelings without any misunderstandings.

P: I
----------
F: So, how's your day going, feeling any better today?
P: Yes, a little bit. As I told you last time, Rosy came over to see me today.
F: Oh, that's great to hear. Did you both had a good chat?
P: Yes, at the beginning, she told me had a rough time with work and after some talking, she confided that she had lost her grandmother recently.
F: It is terrible news; Death of a couple ones can overwhelmingly deplete.
P : Yes, after her words, I just held on her as she sobbed for a while.
F: But some speech may put smile; Hopefully today's reminiscing would have improve satisfactory feat of arousal.

----------
F: Hi there, how have you been doing today?

P: Oh it's been alright I suppose. Had some visitors earlier.

F: That's nice to hear! Tell me a bit more about that.

P: Well I had family come visit me. It's always nice to see them, but unfortunately we had a little disagreement towards the end of their visit.

F: That's too bad. What caused the disagreement?

P: Oh it was just a small misunderstanding that got blown out of proportion. I think we just took what each other were saying the wrong way.

F: That happens sometimes. Have you talked to them since then?

P: Yes, actually. We sorted things out and came to an understanding. It turned out
----------
F: How was your day going?
P: It was fine. Something interesting happened, though.
F: What was it?
P: I went to the supermarket and the lady behind me in the checkout line was in a rush. She kept banging into me with the shopping cart and wasn't saying anything(appearingignoring me) if I would have made a mistake that in the meantime annoyance gestures appeared in her attitudes due to bad manners still standing there even did my shopping so fast but what had gott more mind aboutthis Iseen scenes.
F: Oh wow, that's not very pleasant. How did you react to that situation?
P: I noticed that she had a lot of items that shegot faster-than –usual thus seen
----------
F: How was your day, did anything significant happen?
P: Funny you should ask - had some important chats with my neighbors while out getting some exercise today.
F: That's great, did you enjoy those interactions with your neighbors?
P: Absolutely! We talked mostly about our interests, they gave me some inspirational thoughts, made me happy.
F:Nice, how often do you typically interact with yous neihbor, have lived there forhtong looking?
P: They make an effort on weekends, recently moved there. Especially now I try to say hello every chance I get to feel some connection.
F:That's lovely.When you get novid,outnof your neighbourhood,how many if you interactons with lossliez ones
----------
F: Tell me more about your day-to-day interactions.                               

P: Sometimes, I avoid interactions when I feel overwhelmed. 

F: When do these interactions make you feel overwhelmed?  

P: Crowded and noisy spaces, especially when people start veering too close.

F: That makes sense. What kind of interactions do you prefer?

P: Ones where we have enough personal space. Also, I'm more happy to discuss more sort of a being deep thought subject than over drinking blusters. 

F: Sounds reasonable. Can you share an example of your favorite discussion topic?                     

P: Oh, I think I'm more careful on information flow nowadays. Politics, values, theory-relating underbehavior stuff—almost consuming now
----------
F: Not much to do these days?
P: Not really, been just staying home all the time.

F: That must be difficult for you. Are you keeping in touch with anyone in your family?

F: "So how has your day been?"

P: "Well, it has been pretty good. Except for this one experience."

F: "Oh no, what happened?"

P: "I went to the grocery store and wanted to ask the employee where to find some honey, but I guess I didn't speak loudly enough because they didn't seem to hear me."

F: "Did you try asking someone else for help?"

P: "Yes, another person tried to help me, luckily."

F: "Where else have you had similar interactions?"

P: "At church. Sometimes I can't quite understand what the priest is saying during his sermon."

F: "Have you tried sitting closer or asking someone after the church service for clarification
----------
F: So, do you do any activities during the day that involve socializing with others like reading a newspaper or attending an event?

P: Yes, I usually read newspaper which I leave outside in the lobby, and a couple of residents divert from their trail to mourn and have a daily chitchat topic with 'happy'. Moreover, other hospice groups send holy bead-wearing attendants, unique veternians with carts, program groups (zebra carts,) mental hospitalized era dancers seated which shake bells.

F: That sounds really nice. Do you ever watch TV or movies with any of your friends from here ?

P: I occasionally stay seated outside multiple rooms including mutual friend's Jessie who itself next watches morning TV series except some remote squeezing

                F: Did you guys talk?

                P: She said hi, but that was about it.

                F: Can I ask what happened?

                 P: We broke up about a year ago.

                F: I’m sorry to hear that.

                P: The relationship was just not working out.

                F: Have you been dating anyone else since?

                 P: Not really, just going out with some friends.

F: Hi, any interesting stories you have from the past few days?

P: Yes, actually something quite embarrassing happened to me at the grocery store the other day.
 
F: Really? What happened?

P: Well, I was having trouble finding a certain product so I asked one of the employees for help. I couldn't hear her very well from behind our masks...

F: Ah, I've had that trouble before!

P: Anyway, I had quite a hard time understanding her so I said ‘what？’ multiple times before it clicked to me that I might just botch her messages, of which when I realized that she was someone for whom English was a second-language… and my hearing certainly isn't as good as it used
----------
F: What did you do today, did you talk with anyone you know?

P: Yes, I went to the store today and I had to ask for help finding an item.

P: Hi, how are you doing today?

F: I'm good, thank you for asking. How about you?

P: I'm okay. I've noticed that interacting with people sometimes get harder the older you get.

F: Oh, why do you think so?

P: When I was young, I had tons of energy to go out and interact with people. Now, I often feel challenged in gently approaching strangers to start up conversations, especially without any given common experiences the both parties could relate to.

F: Yeah, it definitely feels harder to connect with strangers sometimes.

P: Definitely, travelling on public transport could be stressful if it full of spectators struggling to accept they see world with perception tunaled and filter important close not societal

P: Not too bad, I suppose. Though something rather strange happened the other day.  
F: What happened, could you tell me more about it?
P: I was shopping at the grocery store like usual, and bumped into a neighbor I haven't seen in a while.
F: Okay, did you guys get to catch up at all? 
P: We did, for a bit anyways. I think it was a bit muddled though, I wasn't sure when to stop asking questions. So at a certain point the conversation felt like it stalled - and ultimately it turned juuuuuust a little awkward get-together just trailed off surprisingly rapidly… like I
