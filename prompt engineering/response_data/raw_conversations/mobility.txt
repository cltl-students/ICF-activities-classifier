P: It was okay. Not as eventful as usual, though.
F: Oh, really? What did you end up doing? 
P: Just grocery shopping, trying so hard to get my act together nowadays.
F: That sounds like a good idea. What did you come up with afterwards?

P: No, not really. I've been having more trouble with moving around.

F: Oh no, can you tell me more about that?

P: For example, every time I need to go to the grocery store, I need to take a taxi as home delivery takes too long.

F: I see. How about going to your regular doctor's appointments?

P: The bus stop is too far away from my house. Advancing for a taxi service on a punctilla basis every month would surely leave me out of budget. Sometimes my neighbor takes to me neighbor's car to see him which I really thanks
for doing it.

F: That's difficult. How do you usually
----------
F: Can you tell me about how you get around throughout the day?
