So, do you find it easy to go grocery shopping or do everyday tasks nowadays?	1
F; “That’s great to hear!”	6
Well, not much. Just spending most of the time at home.	5
Oh, today was a bit more exciting than usual. I went to my weekly volunteer work for community services, helping others through counseling and mentorship.	8

I've been alright, just trying to keep up with everything around the house.	5
I typically just make pancakes or scrambled eggs. Occasionally I'll make oatmeal or cinnamon rolls from scratch.	5
Fortunately, I’m not completely dependent on fast food; I know a few tricks to cooking an easy meal using only fresh produce.	0
One time, I just tampered getting caution out and left mechanism hanging, real-life breaker with knowledge ceased plus handled in life process till done wrong.	1
Sounds simple and delicious! How about after breakfast, is there anything you do then?	6
Yeah, I'm used to cooking meals twice a day at home. Maybe I cooked a vegetable curry last night for dinner.	5

What about when you can't find the food that you planned to heat up?	5
Hi! It's good to see you again. How are you doing, today?	6

Oh, wow. Is heshe a pro-singer already? , 	2
Oh, I'm not feeling too bad, thank you.	2
Well, I gestured towards my front yard when talking about my own garden, and my neighbor did the same.	2
It was pretty good. I spent the morning reading the newspaper.	0
The news as usual. Also, I saw an advertisement and heard the phone ring.	2
Yes, I enjoy beautiful old songs, classical melodies recorded a few decades ago.	0
You know, we had some confusion regarding the medication changes, but she’s usually clear whenever I remind her.	2
Yes, I've been learning a new method of communication called memos so I'm doing communication testing at night regarding short-term memory and simple recalling. 	0

That sounds delicious! Is it a typical meal you make at home? 	5
What does your morning routine look like? 	9
Actually it felt great to have my own meal rather disturb the nurses. Plus controlling what I put into my body is a feeling of progress rather than sitting and feeling sick all day.	4
Yes, they are convenient and easy to prepare. I usually buy them a dozen at a time.	5
I added olive oil onto a heated pan and spread sauteed garlic after 30 seconds.	5
That makes a lot of sense. And what about meals -- did you make something good today?	6
What did you have for breakfast this morning?	9
Oh yeah? What happened there? Did everything go well? 	2
I understand. How else do you communicate throughout your day?	6
A little bit. My hearing isn't very good right now, so I had to turn up the volume on my phone.	2

Understandable. well then, I noticed your	9

What types of communication events did you have yesterday, Mr.Ms. patient? 	2
Oh yes, I have a hearing aid that works quite well.	2
Yes, I spoke to the checkout cashier. 	2
Not really, unfortunately. Since my hearing isn't what it used to be, it's harder for me to have longer conversations that intersted me, so I don't often seek out company anymore.	6
And did you do anything else beside that?	9
Great! How about some recent new happenings at home, who did you inform immediately?	6

How did you communicate with your granddaughter last night, Mr. Thompson?	2
That's nice! How about when you want to communicate with others?	2

Oh, not too bad, thanks for askin'.	2
That's nice, how did you interact with them? 	2

It was okay. A caring person on the bus today actually got a seat for me on the bus.	8
I understand how that can be really difficult. Could you tell me about a specific example when you felt like your interactions with people might be affecting your relationships?	6
How has your day been going so far?	9
That's great to hear. What else have you done today that involved interactions with others?	6
Yes, for the most part. As I've gotten older, I've developed my own ways of dealing with people, and most of the interactions I have are quite good.	6
Maybe a change in approach would help. Have you tried using I-messages instead of blaming language like you never listen?	6
It was good. In all honesty though, I miss having company around as I feel life gets too isolated.	6
Well, a few weeks ago we all went out to eat together. My sister ordered onion rings and I made a comment about how she always picks greasy foods. She didn't take it as a joke and we started bickering back	6
Hey there, how was your day?	2

Do you often see positive responses to your verbal	2
Yes, actually my caretaker came over to help me with some chores around the house earlier.	5
Yes, I depend on them to leave a voicemail if I am not able to answer the call unlike my younhger months when I used hearing hardwares to enchance my belongingschaftions with others unfamiliar or had hearing losses and it sheikred my confidence deeply. As for habitual communication everything became history for i'm already embrace deathess tendence6 everywhere.The peace I've maintained by this decision has suffused my	9
What did you do today?	7
Oh, what happened? Could you tell me more about what happened?	6
That's lovely! Have you; had trouble remembering things people said later on?	2
It does make sense! Any other instances when you experience those barriers to communicating?	2
It Was very busy today!	1
Well, it started out fine. In the morning, I watched the morning news to catch up on what's happening in the world.	0
Oh yeah, sounds fruitful! Do you usually hear the newsreadings on radios or TVs?	2

So, how was your day going?	6
I like to have them on in the background while I'm doing household chores or when I go for a walk in the park.	5
Hmm.. Oh, that reminds me. Just this afternoon i thought was great one of doctors' facial conveyed stances. Very straight forward confirmation politely my sentiment prompting convenient arrangement gave me personally multiple talking points.

That's understandable. Have you considered asking for help with those	6
I clean my apartmenttwicea day. 	5
Well, I suppose keeping up with the housework keeps me moving.	5
Yes, I did. But when I came back, I couldn't remember if I turned off the oven. I had to go back and check it.	4
Sometimes I go take a walk around the park or try to cook for myself. It’s just hard standing for too long these days.	3
How are you feeling today?	2
It's the usual routine for me. Woke up in the morning, took a quick shower, and made breakfast.	5
I see. What have you been up to lately that's been making you so tired?	6
Alright, did you have any difficulties while doing it?	9
Well, I get tired more easily nowadays. Fortunately, my granddaughter mainly pushed the cart and she commended me on being able to retrieve most things without any issue. 	3
Generally, I do some errands like grocery shopping or attend doctor’s appointment few times in	8
Could you tell me more about that? 	9
I usually have breakfast and then take a shower. It takes around 30 minutes.	4
Oh yes, I found it was a little windy today, yet invigorating as always.	9
Just simple ones such as cooking meals and taking care of the house's moderate cleanliness.	5
Even if activities' levels of complication varied a lot – dusting some ceramics and glass display which sorted up carrying comparatively sterile itzes up and down; creating environmentally secure mounting for the suet bag bunch obstruct my final single-task devoted nerves.But switching rew itself along throughout work day became necessary to complete household backup before the guests pop.	5
How are you feeling today?	2
Can you tell me a bit more about your routines?	9
That sounds great! Do you have anything planned throughout the day?	1
That is completely understandable. Do you think managing multiple tasks at once is something you do well with handle every day?	1
Well, today I tried to organize a small part of my bookshelf, it didn't end well.	5
That sounds like a great start to the day. What do you do afterwards?	7
Not very. Occasionally, I struggle with trickier lids like on Spill-Proof cups. But, if it's friendly bottle or	4
Could you give me an example of what is difficult?	9
Well, have you tried using a straw to drink instead? 	4
What time of day do you normally enjoy a nice cup of tea?	4
So, how was your day today?	6
How was your day today, sir?	6
