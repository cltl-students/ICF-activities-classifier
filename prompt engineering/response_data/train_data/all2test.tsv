He, did you bike to work today?	3
I actually went by car because I felt tired when I woke up	3
I went for a long walk with the dog, in the rain. That was nice	3
Walking in the rain can be nice indeed	3
Sometimes I walk to work but that takes even longer	3
Walking to work is really exhausting for me	3
I really prefer to take the train or go by car	3
I usually take the bike when I go to work	3
Yesterday I went for a bike ride to the beach in the sun, that was lovely	3
lucky you! I thought there was to much wind to cycle	9
Do you ever go for a long bike ride to the beach?	3
I like taking long bike ride on the beach during sunrise	3
I will ride you on my bike to the bus stop today, to catch the bus to the train station	3
Maybe bike together to the bus? 	8
It has been a while since I biked but sure!	9
Biking can be very nice and relaxing way to exercise	9
True, and it is a great way to explore nature	9
But now with the electric bikes, it is getting more dangerous	9
So many people now have electric bikes!	9
But in traffic you have to pay more attention while biking	3
Yes, and to stay safe you have bike with a helmet	4
That is correct, biking with a helmet is much better	3
But I have bought a bike, and now take long rides also in the hills	3
Oh that is great, I do too!	3
We should go out more together on the bike, it will be fun!	8
Yes, we should! Let's plan for a activity next week	8
I am free next week and would love to plan a bike-ride together	8
Great, I will look for a nice scenic route we can take	9
Thanks! Looking forward	9
But now, I have to hurry for the bus, let's go	9
getting older I notice I don't like taking the buss as easy as I did before	9
what wrong with taking the bus? can you not walk to the bus stop anymore?	3
that's allright. I can walk to the bus stop	3
is it difficult to climb in the bus than?	3
hmm, no it is also fine to climb in the bus	3
okay, getting there; are you able to find a seat when your in the bus?	3
come to think of it; it's the ticketing system in the bus that changed	9
why is the ticketing system a problem	9
the changed the buttons on the ticketing system and now I have to ask people to help me	8
ah, so you might need new glasses to be able to take the buss	9
I think I will have my eyes checked!	9
What did you study?	7
I studied law, but went in a completely different direction	7
So what are you doing now?	9
I have done additional courses focused on management in healthcare	0
Oh, and do you work in that now?	7
Yes, my courses led to a management job in healthcare	7
What education did you do then?	7
A master's degree from the University of Rotterdam.	7
Did you learn a lot from that?	0
Yes, a lot that I can now apply in my job	7
are you still able to take showers?	4
I used to take daily showers, but lately I only take a shower once a week	4
How come, you don't take daily showers anymore?	4
due to the pain in my legs I depend on support to shower	4
that's to bad, do you still enjoy having a shower?	9
yes, very much, even though I need support and sit on a chair when showering	4
good to hear you are still enjoying the shower	9
Do you get help in household chors	5
Yes.I get some help from my kids, they are teenagers now	9
They help me with some  of the more simple tasks	5
What kind of tasks do they help you with?	1
They help me, for example, with vacuuming	5
Are they also responsible for cleaning their own rooms?	5
Yes, they are responsible for taking care of their own room	5
That's helpful and also a good way to prepare themselves for doing the household on their own one day	5
Yes, but there are still a lot of tasks to do	1
Yes, true	9
At the moment, I learn them to wash their own clothes	5
That.s an easy one, since the wasking machine is doing the work	9
Yes, but you still can do a lot wrong haha	9
For exmaple, combining the white with the coloured wash	5
Oops!	9
My wrist hurts when cooking food	5
Oh that's annoying, how come?	9
I think I have arthritis because my wrist seems thick	9
How does that hinder you in cooking then?	5
I am bothered especially when I am cutting ingredients	5
Have you tried cutting with a brace on your wrist?	5
that's a good idea, I'll give that a try	9
yes, I would do that, it helped me a lot when I bruised my wrist	9
Do you have a brace I can borrow for household chores?	5
Yes, I will look it up for you	9
many thanks!	9

It's difficult for me to get up from the toilet recently. 	4
Why so? Is it because your legs are weak?	9
I can' tell why yet. I just feel I have to use my hands to grap something to help myself getting up.	4
How do you usually get up from the toilet? Do you lean your body forward and then use the strength from you feets to help yourself get up? 	4
I didn't pay attention to that accutually. I should try later.	9
Yes, you can try this method, maybe it would help.	9
My kids haven't visited me for almost 2 months already.	6
Maybe they are busy with their work, even though they also want to visit you?	6
Yes, I think they quite busy and that's why I don't want to bother them.	6
Maybe you can have video call with them. Ask how are they recently and tell them that you miss them.	6
Good idea.	9
If you want to spent some time with them, or having dinner with them. You can just tell them your idea. Or you can invite them to your place or visit them at their places?	6

I have not, we are still thinking of buying e-bikes	7
Yes it can be a difficult process, there are so many choices to consider	0
So true, the offer is enormous and it makes it hard to decide	0
I understand! What do you still need before you can decide?	0
I would like to talk to people to help me decide	0
I could help, I have some friends with e-bikes and they already made up their minds	1
That would be awesome	9
Wait, I will give you their numbers, I  will make it much easier to decide for you!	0
You like to make decisions in your work?	0
And do you also like to make decisions about your personal life	0
Let me think about it for a while and come back to you	9

Do you have a brother or sister?	8
I have a brother, but we rarely see each other.	6
Does your physical disability have anything to do with that?	9

That is unfortunate	9
Yes I did	9
I also send you a text message	9
yes, I saw that too	9
Did you understand the text? and how come you did not answer?	2
I understood you perfectly, but suppose I did not have time and forgot all about it	2
My phone is quite old, it is hard to communicate with it	2
maybe ring next time. that is always quicker	2
So when you call me, I might not hear you	2
Let's make an appointment in that case	6
Can you send me a text message if you want to tell me something	2
I will send you a spoken message instead	2
Otherwise you can try to call but I mights not answer	2
In that case I will take another turn	9
Today I was in a Zoom meeting with my team, I still can not believe how well it works	2
For me, it becomes more difficult to understand all these communication possibilites	2
I can imagine, the developments of possibilities to communicate have increased so much	9
I have bought an Iphone  but you have to help me understand how to use it	1
Sure! I would love to show and help you out	9
Can you show me how it works on yours?	9
I will later today	9
I heard from a friend that these phone can also make great photo's these days!	2

so you felt refreshed after the exercises	9
yes, I would recomend everyone to perform exercises after long drives	9
lately stair climbing is becoming more tiresome	3
how come stairclimbing is more intens than it was before	3
I have been in the hospital recently and lost some weight	9
that might be a good explanation for a deteriorating physical fitness. Dit recieve any rehabilitation afterwards?	9
no I did not, because I never had trouble climbing the stairs	3
It might be a good idea to start exercising and strengthen your muscles for stair climbing	9
I thought taking more walk outside. Do you think that helps for stair climbing as well	9
in general you should be able to walk stairs if you take daily walks	3
do you still do your own groceries?	5
yes I do take my own groceries, but I am alway very tired when I get home	5
howcome the groceries make you tired?	5
the groceries seem to get havier by the month	5
is your fitness deteriorating do you think?	9
why would my fitness get any worse? I just as active as always	9
when getting older your muscles will get less strong unless you perform exercises	9
so you think my groceries are not getting havier, but I am getting less strong	5
yes, you might want to consider strength exercises to be able to do your groceries getting less fatigued	5

Especially with cleaning the toilets and bathroom.	5
Oh yes, those are pretty heavy tasks that have to be done at least once a week.	5

No worries, if you are friends, he will understand you.	6

My friend from anti-war association and I feel quite angry about the U.S. blaming the conflicts between Ukrain and Russia.	8

I couldn't mop the floor like how I did before anymore.	5
I am sorry to hear that, but why?	9
I could mop the floor of the whole appartement before. But now, I get pain in my waist already after mopping just the living room floor. I can not bend my waist for a long while anymore.	5
True, bending for a long time will cause excessive load on your waist. Do you need to do any other chores or movement that will require you to bend your waist for a long time?	5
I also did quite some gardening recently. Maybe that also hurt my waist.	5
It might be. You'd better take a rest for a few days and avoid bending your waist. Even if you need to bend your waist, you 'd better just keep it for just a really short while. And if you still have the pain, it's necessary to visit the doctor.	9
